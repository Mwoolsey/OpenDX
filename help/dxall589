#!N  #!Rtall589 Cache Control: Display #!N #!N 
#!N Some modules use the caching system to cache their own 
data. The Display and Image tools are such tools. When using 
software rendering, they cache the images they display in the X 
windows. This is an optimization that can be seen when using 
the Sequencer. When this tool starts repeating itself (in loop or 
palindrome mode), the images are displayed much faster. That is, Display 
(or Image) is pulling them out of the cache instead of 
rerendering the input objects each time. You can observe this effect 
by running the example program MovingCamera.net with software rendering. #!N #!N 
Most of the time this caching behavior is desirable, but in 
some cases it is better turned off. To do that, use 
the Options module to add a "cache" attribute with the integer 
value of 0 (zero), as follows: #!CForestGreen #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--18*   #!N 
o = Options(o, "cache", 0); #!N Display(o, camera); #!EF #!N #!N 
#!EC #!N #!N The Image tool's Configuration dialog box has an 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   option #!EF menu that lets you control its caching. This 
can be useful when one is running a batch job to 
generate an animation in which none of the frames will be 
displayed a second time. #!N #!N Note that the -cache off 
command line option mentioned above has no effect on the internal 
caching that modules themselves perform. Note: You can use the Data 
Explorer command line option -optimize memory, which will automatically set the 
DXDELAYEDCOLORS and DXPIXELTYPE environment variable to the options that consume the 
least memory. The alternative is -optimize precision. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*
