Components #!N #!N #!N The pokes, picks, and pick paths components 
are created as part of the picking process, as implemented by 
the Pick tool. A user writing a module that uses the 
pick structure output by the Pick tool is expected to use 
the pick structure manipulation routines (as described in IBM Visualization Data 
Explorer Programmer's Reference) rather than accessing the pick structure directly. The 
contents of the pick structure are not defined. #!N #!N #!N
