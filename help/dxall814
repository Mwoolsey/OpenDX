#!N  #!Rudfcmps Using 
Default Color Maps #!N #!N #!N When displaying non-delayed color images 
in 8-bit windows, Display assumes that it can specify 225 individual 
colors. If this number is not currently available in the shared 
color map, Display will find the best approximations available. However, this 
may lead to a visible degradation of image quality. Display may 
instead use a private color map. This decision is based on 
the worst-case approximation that it must use with the default color 
map. If this approximation exceeds a threshold, a private color map 
will be used. The approximation quality is measured as Euclidean distance 
between the desired color and the best approximation for that color, 
in an RGB unit cube. #!N #!N An environment variable, DX8BITCMAP, 
sets the level at which the change to using a private 
color map is made. The value of DX8BITCMAP should be a 
number between 0 (zero) and 1 (one), and it represents the 
Euclidean distance in RGB color space, normalized to 1, for the 
maximum allowed discrepancy. If you set DX8BITCMAP to 1, then a 
private color map will never be used. On the other hand, 
if you set DX8BITCMAP to -1, then a private color map 
will always be used. The default is 0.1. See also the
