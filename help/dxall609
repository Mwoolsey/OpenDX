 #!Rall608 Design for Interactive Use #!N #!EC #!N #!N Data Explorer 
is first and foremost designed for interactive exploration using data as 
the raw material for creating, modifying, and understanding imagery. As such, 
the system is designed to permit operation at several different levels 
of expertise: "exploring," "authoring," and "programming." You can engage in exploring 
by opening previously created visual programs (e.g., the visual programs provided 
with Data Explorer) and changing values of the Interactors found in 
Control Panels, changing values in the Image window controls, or by 
manipulating the Sequencer (if one is provided). You author a visual 
program when you place and interconnect additional modules on the VPE 
or reorganize connections between modules already present, or when you create 
a new visual program from scratch. At the advanced level, you 
can learn how to write and add your own custom modules 
to Data Explorer. This involves writing in a traditional programming language 
like C, taking advantage of a rich function library provided, compiling 
your new module, and running your customized version of Data Explorer. 
While it is nice to know you can do this, do 
not worry if you are not a programmer, because you may 
never find a need to write your own module considering how 
powerful the "stock" Data Explorer tool set is. #!N #!N The 
next section addresses those who want to create new visual programs, 
So here are a few tips on design for interactive use.
