#!N  #!Rtall735 DXSHMEM #!N specifies 
whether or not shared memory should be used. The amount of 
memory allocated by Data Explorer for its data and object management 
can be set at runtime with the -memory command line option. 
At startup, Data Explorer either allocates a shared memory segment or 
expands the existing data segment to create this space. #!N #!N 
SMP (multiprocessor) systems are required to use shared memory so each 
processor can share a common data space. SGI systems also use 
shared memory for space. IBM systems use shared memory if the 
size to be allocated is larger than 256 MB. In all 
other cases Data Explorer extends the existing data segment using the 
brk() system call. #!N #!N Each architecture (SGI, IBM, HP, ...) 
has a different way of configuring the maximum user data segment 
size, and a different way of setting the limit on the 
maximum size of a single shared memory segment. Consult your system 
administrator or system documentation if you have problems getting Data Explorer 
to use the amount of memory which should be available to 
you. #!N #!N If you have problems using a large data 
segment, you can force Data Explorer to use shared memory by 
setting the DXSHMEM environment variable to any value other than -1. 
This will override the defaults and use shared memory for space. 
Alternatively, you can force Data Explorer to extend the data segment 
(if allowed for the architecture) by setting DXSHMEM to -1. Note: 
Regardless of the setting of DXSHMEM, the aviion and sun4 architectures 
always use the data segment. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic
