#!N #!N When you create a visual program using the User 
Interface, the .net file saved is a script, so you can 
run it in script mode. (User Interface-specific information, such as placement 
of tools on the canvas, is saved as comments in the 
script.) If you have a sequencer in your visual program, the 
User Interface adds a "play" command as the last line of 
the .net file. Thus you can edit this line out and 
add your own options if you want to do something other 
than play forward through the sequence once (see  #!Lvcrcomm,dxall549 h Sequencer  #!EL  ). If 
you do not have a sequencer in your visual program, the 
User Interface adds a call to "main()," the main macro which 
is defined to be your top level visual program. If you 
do not want the program to automatically execute when you read 
it in as a script, remove or comment out the call 
to "main()." #!N #!N If your visual program uses macros, the 
user interface will add an "include" line so that the macros 
will be included when the visual program is run as a 
script. You can look at the top of the .net file 
to see which macros are referenced by the program. Thus if 
you need to send a collection of visual programs and macros 
to another person, this can help you to make sure you 
have sent all the necessary tools. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next
