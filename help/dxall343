#!N It is possible to create large visual programs in Data 
Explorer. Data Explorer provides two tools, Transmitter and Receiver, to maintain 
the modularity and readability of large programs. These tools allow connections 
between input and output tabs without using a visible connecting line. 
Using the Transmitter and Receiver tools allows you to separate visual 
programs into logical blocks. For example, the output of several logical 
blocks can be transmitted to another block that receives them, collects 
them, and produces the image. Macros, described in  #!Lmacros,dxall435 h Creating and Using Macros  #!EL  , provide 
another way to structure visual programs into logical blocks. #!N #!N 
To remotely connect input and output tabs: #!N #!I0 #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--18*   
#!N #!N #!I30 #!N 1. Select the Transmitter tool, which appears 
under the Special category in the tool palette, and place it 
near the output tab. #!N #!I30 #!N 2. Connect the tool's 
output tab to the input tab of the Transmitter. #!N #!I30 
#!N 3. Select the Receiver tool (also in the Special category), 
and place it near the input tab to be connected to 
the output tab above. #!N #!I30 #!N 4. Connect the Receiver's 
output tab to the receiving tool icon's input tab. #!N #!N 
The Receiver automatically assumes the same name as the Transmitter. There 
can be multiple instances of a Receiver corresponding to a single 
Transmitter. These Receivers assume the same name until a new Transmitter 
is selected. #!N #!N The name of a Transmitter and Receiver 
can be changed using the notation field of the Configuration dialog 
box (as described in  #!Lucb,dxall345 h Entering Values in a Configuration Dialog Box  #!EL  ). When you change the name 
of the Transmitter, all Receivers that share a name with that 
Transmitter also change their names. However, when you change the name 
of a particular Receiver, the associated Transmitter and the other Receivers 
are not affected. #!N #!I0 #!N #!EF #!N #!N #!N #!N
