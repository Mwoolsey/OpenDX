#!CSeaGreen #!N  #!Rall377 Using Data-Driven Colormap 
Editors #!N #!EC #!N #!N The Colormap Editor may be  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   
data-driven #!EF , meaning that its attributes (e.g., minimum and maximum) 
can be set by connecting the output of a tool to 
the input of the Colormap tool in the VPE or by 
typing a value into the Colormap configuration dialog box, instead of 
into the Colormap Editor itself. #!N #!N If the Colormap Editor 
is data-driven, the information transmitted via the connections or set in 
the Configuration dialog box overrides values set in the Colormap Editor. 
#!N #!N Data-driven Colormap Editors allow you to create color maps 
that are appropriate for a variety of input data sets without 
the need to reset the minimum and maximum of the color 
map. #!N #!N The Colormap tool has a data input to 
which an input data field may be connected. In this case, 
the Colormap Editor is automatically set so that the minimum is 
the minimum of the data set and the maximum is the 
maximum of the data set. However, if you would like to 
have more control over the exact values that are used, the 
Colormap tool allows you to specify the minimum and maximum directly 
through other input tabs that are by default hidden. You can 
also pass a color map or opacity map directly to the 
Colormap tool. The inputs for the Colormap tool are summarized in 
the corresponding module description in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference. 
#!N #!N Each time an input to a data-driven Colormap Editor 
is changed (e.g., by importing a new data set), the interactor 
is reexecuted, updating its attributes. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic
