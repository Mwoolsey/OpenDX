Some architectures have a default configuration which limits the size of 
shared memory segments (see the architecture specific README file in /usr/lpp/dx), 
and the system configuration must be changed as root to increase 
the maximum allowed size of a shared memory segment. If the 
maximum is not reset or if it is already set to 
a different limit, then you can use DXSHMEMSEGMAX to tell Data 
Explorer what the current limit is in megabytes (e.g. 128 == 
128 MB). Data Explorer will allocate multiple shared memory segments if 
necessary to get the total amount of space, but it must 
be able to allocate them at contiguous virtual memory addresses. #!N
