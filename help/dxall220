Faces, Loops, and Edges Components #!N #!N #!N The "faces," "loops," 
and "edges" components are used for special-purpose applications, such as fonts 
or geometric models. The "faces" component represents a set of faces, 
each described as a set of loops. Each entry in the 
face Array is a single integer index into the "loops" Array 
identifying the first of a consecutive set of loops for this 
face. The loops are listed in order of the faces they 
are associated with, so that the list of loops for face 
 #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i #!EF ends in the loops Array just before the 
first loop for face  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i+1 #!EF . Each entry in 
the "loops" Array is a single integer index into the "edges" 
Array, identifying the first of a consecutive set of edges for 
this loop. The edges are listed in order of the loops 
they are associated with, so that the list of edges for 
loop  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i #!EF in the edges Array ends just before 
the first edge for loop  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i+1 #!EF . Each entry 
in the edges Array is a single integer index into the 
"points" Array identifying one vertex of an edge; the other vertex 
of an edge is the next entry in the "edges" Array, 
except that the last edge in a loop that connects the 
last point to the first point is not listed explicitly. This 
is illustrated in  #!Ledarray26,dxall220 f Figure 26  #!EL  . #!Cbrown #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--18*    #!Redarray26 #!N #!N

#!N #!N It is assumed that the first loop for each 
face is the enclosing loop, and that subsequent loops, if any, 
are holes in the face. If this is not true, then 
set the DX_NESTED_LOOPS environment variable (see  #!Lmorevar,dxall695 h Other Environment Variables  #!EL  ). However, setting this 
environment variable will cause a decrease in performance when processing faces, 
loops, and edges data. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF
