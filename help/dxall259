#!CSeaGreen #!N  #!Rall258 Groups #!N #!EC #!N #!N Fields can be 
combined into  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Groups #!EF . A Group is a collection 
of  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   members #!EF that themselves may be Fields or other 
Groups. A member can be referred to either by name or 
by index. An example of a Group is given in  #!Lgroup35,dxall259 f Figure 35  #!EL

Group #!EF #!N #!EC #!N #!N This example shows a Group 
describing a visualization scene composed of two parts. The member named 
"pressure" is a Field of volumetric data to be volume rendered, 
representing pressure in an airflow around an airplane. The member named 
"airplane" is a geometric model describing the surface of the airplane. 
It, in turn, can be a Group, where each member is 
one of the constituent parts of the airplane, such as "wing," 
"fuselage," and so on. The top-level Group could then be passed 
into the renderer to produce an image of the airplane combined 
with a volume rendering of the pressure Field. #!N #!N Named 
Group members can be retrieved by name or by index number; 
the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   n #!EF members of a Group are numbered from 
0 to  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   n-1 #!EF . Group members can also be 
stored by index number without a name, in which case they 
can be retrieved only by index number. The members of a 
Group are always numbered consecutively starting at 0, and gaps in 
the numbering are not allowed. #!N #!N In addition to generic 
Groups used to collect related information, there are three subclasses of 
Group used to combine related Objects with additional semantics:  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Multigrid 
#!EF Groups,  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Composite Field #!EF Groups, and  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Series #!EF
