 #!Rall614 TV Color Resolution #!N #!EC #!N #!N Standard TV is 
simply not capable of correctly rendering fully saturated colors, like red 
(in particular) or blue. Large areas of fully saturated colors will 
pulse and "bleed"; that is, they will smear to the right 
(due to the direction the TV raster scan is moving). This 
smears any sharp edges on your objects and will severely degrade 
the quality of your visualization. The color problem can best be 
dealt with by never using fully saturated colors. Instead, when building 
your color maps, lower the entire Saturation curve to about 0.8. 
Although this will look much more pastel than you might prefer, 
once you have converted the images to TV, these colors will 
brighten up again. What looks kind of pink on the RGB 
workstation monitor will usually be much redder on TV. Of course, 
if you are producing images for another medium, like a color 
printer, you can set the color saturations appropriately (fully saturated may 
be correct in that case: the tips in this section are 
to help you make better video recordings). #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*
