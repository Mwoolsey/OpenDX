#!N  #!Rmemng Memory Management #!N #!EC #!N #!N The executive is 
responsible for managing Objects successfully returned as output by modules and 
for the memory allocated to those Objects. Any memory allocated or 
any Objects created that are not returned as output are the 
responsibility of the module. For instance, in an unsuccessful execution of 
a module, no Objects are returned. It is important that the 
programmer remember this difference when writing a module. #!N #!N #!N
