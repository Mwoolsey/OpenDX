#!CSeaGreen #!N  #!Rall568 What is the Difference Between Image and Display? 
#!N #!EC #!N #!N Image, Display, and Render all render an 
object (i.e. create an image). #!N #!N Render, given an object 
and a camera, creates as output an image. This image can 
be sent directly to Display for display to the screen, sent 
to WriteImage to be written to a file, or collected with 
other images into a single window using Arrange. #!N #!N Display, 
given an object and a camera, both renders the object (using 
the camera) and displays it to the screen. #!N #!N Display, 
given only an image, simply displays it to the screen. #!N 
#!N Image, given an object, renders it and displays it to 
the screen. The camera information is provided via direct interactors (rotate, 
zoom, etc.) or through the camera mode option in the View 
Control dialog box. Image has two outputs: the object to be 
rendered (including any AutoAxes that may have been added via menu 
choices) and the camera used. #!N #!N You would use Render 
if you needed the image itself, for example, for the Arrange 
or Filter modules, or if you wanted to use WriteImage. (For 
the Image tool, the WriteImage function is available through the Save 
Image and Print Image commands in the Image window, or through 
the hidden recordEnable, recordFormat, and recordFile parameters to the Image tool). 
#!N #!N You would use Display without a camera if your 
object is already an image, and you simply want to display 
it. You do not need (or want) to render it. You 
would also use Display without a camera to display a set 
of Arranged images. #!N #!N You would use Display with a 
camera if you wanted to directly control the camera, for example, 
for a computed fly-through path. You would also use Display if 
you wanted to define your own direct interaction modes (see  #!Lsupwind,dxall961 h SuperviseWindow  #!EL  
and  #!Lsupstat,dxall958 h SuperviseState  #!EL  in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference), rather than 
using the predefined direct interaction modes of the Image tool. #!N
