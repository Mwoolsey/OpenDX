Macro Body #!N #!EC #!N #!N The macro body consists of 
a sequence of assignment statements and function calls surrounded by braces 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   { } #!EF . The functions referred to in these 
statements need not exist when a macro is defined; however, they 
must exist when it is executed. #!N #!N Recursive and mutually 
recursive macro invocations are detected and prevented from executing. Statements are 
not guaranteed to execute in the order given in the macro's 
declaration, although some partial ordering is always preserved. Calls to modules 
that cause external side effects (such as Display) are always executed 
in the order in which they were specified. #!N #!N #!N
