#!CSeaGreen #!N  #!Rddinter Using Data-Driven Interactors #!N #!EC #!N #!N Most 
of the interactor types may be  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   data-driven #!EF , meaning 
that their attributes, such as minimum, maximum, increment, and label, may 
be set by connecting the output of a tool to the 
input of the interactor stand-in in the VPE or by a 
value typed into the interactor stand-in's Configuration dialog box, rather than 
by using the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Set Attributes #!EF dialog box for the 
interactor. #!N #!N If an interactor is data-driven, then the information 
transmitted via connections or set in the Configuration dialog box overrides 
the values set via the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Set Attributes #!EF dialog box 
and causes the corresponding values in the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Set Attributes #!EF 
dialog box to be grayed out. #!N #!N Data-driven interactors allow 
you to create visual programs that will work with a variety 
of input data sets without the need to reset the interactor 
attributes to be in a range appropriate for the data being 
used. For example, a scalar interactor controlling an isosurface value can 
be data-driven by connecting the input data field to it. The 
interactor is then automatically set so that its minimum and maximum 
span the range of the data. #!N #!N Data-driven interactors have 
a data input to which an input data field may be 
connected. In this case the interactor automatically chooses the minimum, maximum, 
and increment. However, if you would like to have more control 
over the exact values that are used, the interactors allow you 
to specify them directly through other input tabs that are by 
default hidden. For example, you may wish to set the minimum 
and maximum for an interactor to go from the minimum of 
the data values to the midpoint of the data values, rather 
than to the maximum. In this case, you can use the 
"min" and "max" input tabs of the interactor rather than the 
"data" tab. #!N #!N The interactors that can be data-driven are 
Integer, Scalar, Vector, IntegerList, ScalarList, VectorList, Selector, SelectorList, and Toggle. In 
 #!Lfmd,dxall765 h Functional Modules  #!EL  in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference, the inputs for 
each of these interactors are described on the manual page corresponding 
to that interactor. #!N #!N Each time an input to a 
data-driven interactor is changed (for example, by importing a new data 
set) the interactor is reexecuted, updating its attributes. If the current 
setting of the interactor lies within the new range allowed, the 
interactor value does not change. If the current setting is outside 
the new allowed range, the current setting is reset to the 
midpoint of the new minimum and maximum. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*
