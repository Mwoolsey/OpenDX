#!EC #!N #!N To prevent the executable program of the outboard 
module from exiting after each execution, set the PERSISTENT flag on 
the FLAGS line in its  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   .mdf #!EF file. This setting 
may be necessary so that the module can save information from 
one execution to another, or because repeated exits and restarts take 
too much time. #!N #!N A persistent outboard module is started 
from the user interface the first time the module is called 
and does not exit until its icon is deleted from the 
network (program), the entire network is deleted, or the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Reset 
Server #!EF option is selected from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Connection #!EF pull-down 
menu. #!N #!N In script mode, persistent outboard modules are loaded 
the first time they are called and they do not exit 
until the executive exits or the command #!CForestGreen #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--18*

#!N Global variables can be safely used to save information between 
executions of an outboard module. If the same outboard module occurs 
in a network more than once, a different process is started 
for each occurrence. #!N #!N Note that the module may not 
be called at every execution: If the inputs are changed from 
their original values and then back again, Data Explorer saves the 
previous results and uses them without recalling the module. The "cache 
none" option prevents previous results from being saved, but you also 
need to set "cache none" for all downstream modules that process 
the outputs. Otherwise, caching at the lower levels will still prevent 
the module from being called each time. The SIDE_EFFECT flag specifies 
that the module is to be called each time, the performance 
penalty being that the module continues to execute even if the 
inputs remain unchanged. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N
