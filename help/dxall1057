#!N #!EC #!N #!N DXReadyToRun cannot be called from the time 
a module receives its inputs until after it returns its outputs. 
To trigger another execution immediately, it can do so after the 
call to DXCallOutboard() in the outboard.c file. #!N #!N Outboard modules 
cannot be written in coroutine style. They cannot produce outputs without 
being called by Data Explorer and thereby receiving new inputs (which 
can be ignored), and they must return something - the main 
Data Explorer executive will wait for the module to return before 
continuing. #!N #!N An asynchronous module cannot be run in distributed 
mode, but it can be executed on another machine by setting 
the host name on the OUTBOARD line. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*
