#!N  #!Regnpols Edges and Polylines 
#!N #!N #!N "Polylines" are a way of collecting a set 
of line segments into a single object with which data can 
be associated. They are implemented much as faces, loops, and edges 
are (see above). An "edges" component contains the indices of the 
vertices along polylines. A "polylines" component contains the indices of the 
first element in the "edges" component of each polyline sequence. In 
other words, the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i #!EF (th) element of the "polylines" 
component is the index in the "edges" component at which the 
sequence of vertex indices of polyline  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i #!EF starts. The 
sequence corresponding to polyline[  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   i #!EF ] continues to the 
beginning of the next polyline sequence (or to the end of 
the "edges" component). Polyline data may be dependent on either "polylines" 
or "positions." #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N #!N
