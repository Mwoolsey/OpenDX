Arithmetic Expressions #!N #!EC #!N #!N You can combine scalar values 
and variables that contain values with the arithmetic operators listed below 
to derive new values. Lists of scalars can also be combined 
if the lists have the same cardinality (number of elements), or 
if one of the lists has just a single element. If 
the two lists being operated upon have the same number of 
elements, then the operator is applied to the corresponding element pairs 
in each list to produce a new list of the same 
cardinality. If one of the lists has just a single element, 
then the operator is applied, in turn, to each of the 
elements of the larger list and to that single element to 
produce a list whose size is the same as the larger 
list. #!N #!N If both of the elements in an operation 
are the same type, either integer or floating point, then the 
result of the operation is also of the same type. If, 
however, one of the elements is an integer and the other 
is a floating-point value, then the result is a floating-point value. 
Given this automatic type conversion, a simple way to convert an 
integer value to a floating-point value is to add 0.0 to 
it. #!N #!N #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N
