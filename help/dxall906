#!N  #!Rlinmark Using Line Markers #!N You 
may also choose markers for your plot lines. You may set 
a "mark" attribute on the input lines using the Options module. 
"mark" should have as a value one of the following: "circle," 
"diamond," "dot," "square," "star," "triangle," or "x." By default, a mark 
is placed at every point on the line. You can also 
set a "mark every" attribute with an integer as a value. 
For example, the value 3 would cause every third point to 
be marked. You can control the size of the mark using 
the "mark scale" attribute, which applies a scale factor to the 
default mark size. For example, a "mark scale" value of 2 
would make the marks twice as large. If you are using 
the "label" attribute, the mark will also appear in the legend. 
Note: The "dot" mark type will only be visible if you 
also set the "scatter" attribute to 1 (see  #!Lscatplt,dxall909 h Scatter Plots  #!EL  ). #!N
