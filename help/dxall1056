 #!Rall1055 Running an outboard on another machine: #!N #!EC #!N #!N 
If an outboard module should be run on one particular machine 
(perhaps because it is compute intensive and needs to run on 
a fast machine, or because it needs to access a peripheral 
that is connected to only one machine), the OUTBOARD line can 
specify a host name as well as an executable name. The 
Data Explorer libraries will take care of establishing a connection between 
where the main Data Explorer executive is running and the outboard 
host machine. The DXMODULES environment variable or the -modules flag can 
be used to specify a search path for outboard module executables, 
or the OUTBOARD line can specify a fully qualified path name. 
#!N #!N A valid .rhosts file must be present to allow 
Data Explorer to use the "rsh" command to start a process 
on another machine. (See the UNIX manual page for "rsh" or 
"remsh" for more information.) #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF
