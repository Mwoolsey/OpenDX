#!N  #!Rtall713 DXGAMMA #!N sets the gamma correction for software-rendered images 
displayed to the screen by a Display or Image tool. On 
many display devices a given change in the digital brightness of 
the image is not reflected in a corresponding change in screen 
brightness. A gamma correction is a nonlinear adjustment of the pixel 
values to compensate for this difference and produce a more accurate 
representation on the screen. By default (except for 8-bit windows on 
the sgi architecture), the correction factor (exponent) is 2 (two), on 
the assumption that the display is not otherwise gamma corrected. The 
DXGAMMA variable allows you to override this default. In particular, if 
the display device is already gamma corrected, set the variable to 
1 (one). (See Display in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference, 
and README_sgi in /usr/lpp/dx.) #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF
