 #!Rsergrp Series Groups #!N #!EC #!N #!N Series of various types, 
such as time series, are stored in a subclass of Group 
called a  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Series #!EF Object. A Series Object is the 
same as a generic Group in most respects, except that it 
associates a series value, such as a time stamp, with each 
member. Members are stored in and retrieved from a Series Group 
by index. Members cannot be retrieved by series value. Fields in 
a Series Group must all have the same data type and 
connection element type.  #!Lseriesx36,dxall262 f Figure 36  #!EL  shows an example of a Series Group, 
where the three members have series positions of 1.2, 2.7, and 
8.4 respectively. #!Cbrown #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--18*    #!Rseriesx36 #!N #!N Graphics omitted from
