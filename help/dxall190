#!CSeaGreen #!N  #!Rall189 Rendering #!N #!EC #!N #!N The process of 
 #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   rendering #!EF an image involves a computer calculation of the 
amount of light falling on each visible surface of the objects 
in the "scene," as seen from the point of view of 
the computer "camera" (the viewer's eye point). During the rendering process, 
surface properties of objects are taken into account as are the 
colors of both the objects and the "lights" shining on them. 
In other words, a computer graphics renderer samples the scene in 
front of the camera at the resolution of the computer monitor 
on which the scene is to be displayed. Its sample space 
is the 3-dimensional "world" containing the objects. But the image renderer 
does not create a 3-dimensional picture; it only calculates the colors 
of the dots that can be seen on the 2-dimensional monitor 
screen from the chosen point of view. Any parts of objects 
that cannot be seen from that point of view are neither 
sampled nor rendered, nor are they stored in the image file 
or displayed on the monitor. This 2-dimensional image may appear 3-dimensional 
to our eyes because of shading, occlusion of distant objects by 
closer ones, and other visual cues that, in the real world, 
indicate dimensionality. Like any image, it is a representation, however real 
it may appear. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N
