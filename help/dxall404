#!CSeaGreen #!N  #!Rcpa Control Panel Access, Groups, and 
Hierarchies #!N #!EC #!N #!N You may wish to organize your 
Control Panels into groups or hierarchies depending on how the interactors 
in the Control Panels relate. For example, you may have a 
few Control Panels that are tightly related and wish to have 
them treated as a group. Data Explorer provides you with the 
means of placing these Control Panels into a group so that 
they can be opened together. #!N #!N If you have a 
master Control Panel that should be open before any other controls, 
Data Explorer provides you with the capability of restricting access to 
these Control Panels from any Data Explorer window except the master 
Control Panel. Access to Control Panel groups can be done in 
a similar fashion. Restricting access to Control Panels in this way 
allows you to build Control Panels into hierarchical structures. #!N #!N 
A special type of Control Panel access can be achieved by 
specifying which Control Panels are automatically opened when Data Explorer is 
started with the Image window or menu bar as the anchor 
(using the -image or -menubar option). #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next
