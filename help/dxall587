Cache Control: Executive #!N #!N #!N In general, it is not 
necessary to change how the executive caches intermediate results. However, in 
a few cases, it may be advantageous to do so. For 
example, if you are reading a live data feed into your 
program, it is probably not necessary to cache the downstream outputs. 
#!N #!N You can change how and if the executive caches 
intermediate output values by opening the Configuration dialog box of a 
module and changing the option menu to the right of each 
output. You can also choose  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Output Cacheability #!EF from the 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Edit #!EF menu of the VPE, and set the cacheability 
of a group of modules, show the cacheability of a group 
of modules, or ask Data Explorer to use a heuristic to 
automatically optimize the caching for the current visual program. #!N #!N 
In general, it is most efficient to cache only the results 
of the last module in a single file line of modules; 
for example to cache the output of Isosurface, but not Import. 
Note that if you do this, however, if you need to 
change the isosurface value, the data file will need to be 
reimported, slowing execution. #!N #!N If you want to turn off 
caching altogether you can use the -cache off command-line option to 
Data Explorer. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N #!N
