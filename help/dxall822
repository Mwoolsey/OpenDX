 #!Robjfuzz Object fuzz #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Object fuzz #!EF is 
a method of resolving conflicts between objects at the same distance 
from the camera. For example, it may be desirable to define 
a set of lines coincident with a plane. Normally it will 
be unclear which object is to be displayed in front. In 
addition, single-pixel lines are inherently inaccurate (i.e. they deviate from the 
actual geometric line) by as much as one-half pixel; when displayed 
against a sloping surface, this  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   x #!EF or  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   y 
#!EF inaccuracy is equivalent to a  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   z #!EF inaccuracy related 
to the slope of the surface. The "fuzz" attribute specifies a 
 #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   z #!EF value that will be added to the object 
before it is compared with other objects in the scene, thus 
resolving this problem. The fuzz value is specified in pixels. For 
example, a fuzz value of one pixel can compensate for the 
described half-pixel inaccuracy when the line is displayed against a surface 
with a slope of two. #!N #!N #!T,1,161,321,646  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   #!N TAB
