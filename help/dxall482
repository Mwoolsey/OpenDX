#!CNavyBlue #!N  #!Rdebug Using the Message Window #!N 
#!EC #!N #!N The Message window allows you to monitor the 
progress of a visual program as it executes. It displays information, 
warning and error messages from the executive and output from the 
Print and Echo modules (if you include them in your visual 
program). #!N #!N You can use the Print module, for example, 
to print the contents of an object. See Print in IBM 
Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference for more information. You can use 
the Echo module to print values or strings. See Echo in 
IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference. #!N #!N To open the 
Message window, select the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Open Message Window #!EF option from 
the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Windows #!EF pull-down menu of either the Image window 
or the VPE window. The Message window consists of a text 
window and various pull-down menus. When a visual program is running, 
any information, warnings, or errors sent by the server to the 
user interface are shown in the display area. (See also  #!Lermsgs,dxall297 h Error Messages  #!EL  
.) #!N #!N The Message window allows users to save the 
contents of the text window in two different ways. The  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   
Save As... #!EF command of the Message window's  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   File #!EF 
menu brings up a File Selection dialog box that allows the 
user to designate a file to which the current contents of 
text window are to be saved. Alternatively, the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Log... #!EF 
command of the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   File #!EF menu brings up a File 
Selection dialog box that allows the user to designate a file 
that will receive all subsequent messages displayed in the text window. 
#!N #!N The Message window provides a number of techniques to 
help the user locate the source of errors and warnings. Before 
each successful execution of the visual program, the string "Begin execution" 
is placed in the text window. This allows the user to 
more easily determine whether messages are the result of the most 
recent execution. Also, any line in the text window can be 
highlighted before execution. Highlighted lines remain highlighted over executions, making it 
easy to locate a marker indicating the beginning of execution. This 
technique is particularly useful when a large amount of information (from 
Print or Echo) is being displayed in the Message window. Alternatively, 
the contents of the text window can be removed with the 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Clear #!EF option of the Message window's  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   File #!EF 
menu. #!N #!N When an error occurs during the execution of 
a module, the errant module can be located in the VPE 
by double-clicking on the line in the Message window's text window 
containing the error message. This selection causes the VPE's canvas to 
shift so that the indicated module is within the canvas's scrolled 
viewing area. Errors for the last execution can also be located 
using the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Next Error #!EF and  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Previous Error #!EF 
commands of the Message window's  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Edit #!EF menu. These commands 
expose and highlight errors that occurred before or after the currently 
highlighted error. If no error is currently highlighted, then  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Previous 
Error #!EF indicates the last error during execution and  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Next 
Error #!EF indicates the first error. #!N #!N The Message window 
can be configured so that it does not display certain message 
types in the text window (by using the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Error Messages 
#!EF ,  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Warning Messages #!EF , and  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Information Messages 
#!EF buttons in the Message window's  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Options #!EF pull-down menu). 
If a toggle button is activated (colored), the corresponding message type 
is displayed. The default behavior is to display all error, warning, 
and information messages. You can change this default behavior with the 
infoEnabled, warningEnabled, and errorEnabled configuration options described in  #!Lapf,dxall745 h User Interface Configuration  #!EL  . By 
default, the Message window pops up when an error is displayed 
in the text window and does not automatically pop up when 
information or warning messages are displayed. You can also change this 
default behavior with the infoOpensMessage, warningOpensMessage, and errorOpensMessage configuration options described 
in  #!Lapf,dxall745 h User Interface Configuration  #!EL  . #!N #!N Lastly, when connected to the server, 
the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute Script Command... #!EF command of the Message window's 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Options #!EF menu allows commands to be issued directly to 
the server. However, only advanced users should use this feature, as 
the results of the commands entered can upset the state of 
the visual program. This command brings up the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute Script 
Command #!EF dialog box, which will accept a single command in 
a 1-line text window. Any messages that result from this command 
appear in the Message window's text window. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*
