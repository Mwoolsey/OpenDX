 #!Rmacts Moving and Copying Tools #!N #!EC #!N #!N The Drag 
and Drop capability provided by Data Explorer allows you to move 
or copy selected tools within a Data Explorer window (e.g., the 
VPE or a control panel) or between different Data Explorer windows 
(i.e., between two different VPE windows). You can also drag interactor 
stand-ins to control panels to create interactors. #!N #!N To initiate 
a drag and drop, first select the tools you want to 
move or copy, either by rubber-band or shift selection. Then place 
the mouse cursor over one of the selected tools and press 
the middle mouse button. Keeping the button pressed, move the cursor 
to an empty spot on the canvas and release the button. 
A copy of the selected tool will be placed where the 
mouse button was released. To do a cut and drop (move), 
use Shift-middle mouse button. #!N #!N When dragging and dropping tools 
from the VPE, you may drop the tools on a VPE 
in another Data Explorer session or in another VPE (i.e., macro 
editor) of the same Data Explorer session. Interactors in control panels 
can only be dragged and dropped between panels in the same 
visual program. #!N #!N If you drag a set of tools 
to an inappropriate window (e.g., from a control panel to a 
VPE), no action will occur. If you drag a set of 
tools that includes transmitters, the latter (along with their corresponding receivers) 
will be renamed to wireless-1, wireless-2, and so on. Note: To 
include an existing .net file in the VPE, use the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   
Insert Visual Program #!EF option of the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Edit #!EF pull-down 
menu in the VPE. The inserted visual program is placed to 
the right of the rightmost tool in the existing network. #!N
