#!EC #!N #!N A probe is a list of one or 
more vectors that represent points in the image. You can use 
them with Data Explorer modules that accept vectors as input, such 
as ClipPlane and Streamline. #!N #!N After you execute a visual 
program and have an image in the Image window, you can 
modify the visual program to include a  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Probe #!EF or 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   ProbeList #!EF tool from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Special #!EF category. The 
probe tool accepts input from the 3-D cursor tool, specifying the 
points to use as vectors for input into another tool. The 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Probe #!EF tool accepts one point as its input; the 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   ProbeList #!EF tool accepts multiple points as input. #!N #!N 
To use probes to select points for input into tools: #!N 
#!I0 #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--18*   #!N #!N #!I30 #!N 1. Execute a visual 
program to produce an image in the Image window. #!N #!I30 
#!N 2. In the VPE, place one or more probe tools 
from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Special #!EF category in the visual program, connecting 
them to the tools for which you want to provide input. 
#!N #!N The probe icons are numbered as you place them 
on the canvas. For example, the first probe icon you place 
is labeled "Probe_1," the second "Probe_2," and so on. You can 
change the label of the icon by using its Configuration dialog 
box. #!N #!I30 #!N 3. In the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   View Control... #!EF 
dialog box, select  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Cursors #!EF mode from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Mode 
#!EF option box, or use the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Ctrl+X #!EF accelerator key. 
A wire frame appears around the object. The dialog box changes 
to add the Probe controls. Select the probe you want to 
set by choosing the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Probe(s) #!EF option box. This opens 
an options menu with a list of the available probes, from 
which you can select the desired probe. #!N #!I30 #!N 4. 
Use the mouse to select a point or points to use 
as input to the tool connected to the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Probe #!EF 
or  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   ProbeList #!EF icon. #!N #!N To add a point, 
double-click on the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   left #!EF mouse button inside the wire-frame 
box. A small square box appears, marking the point. #!N Note: 
The  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Probe #!EF tool allows only one point, while the 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   ProbeList #!EF allows several. #!N #!N #!N To move a 
point, select the point by pressing the left mouse button with 
the mouse pointer positioned on it. When the left mouse button 
is depressed on the point, the three projections (one for each 
axis) appear inside the wire-frame box as dots, and the values 
for the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   x, y, #!EF and  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   z #!EF coordinates 
are displayed on the right side of the Image window menu 
bar, as illustrated in  #!Ltdcurs59,dxall321 f Figure 59  #!EL  . You can move the point 
by dragging the selected point inside the box along the same 
direction as any of the axes. When you have moved the 
point to the desired area, release the left mouse button. #!N 
#!N Note that since perspective projection does not preserve parallel lines, 
the directions in the axes diagram do not necessarily correspond with 
the direction that the point moves in the Image window. However, 
these axes do correspond with the values of the coordinates. #!N 
#!N While using orthographic projection, the movement of the point in 
the Image window corresponds to the directions of the axes diagram. 
#!N #!N To delete a point, double click on it with 
the left mouse button. #!N #!N You can restrict the movement 
of the 3-D cursor with the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Constraints #!EF option. Selecting 
the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Constraints #!EF option box reveals an options menu that 
lets you choose which of the three axis projections to that 
movement is constrained. For example, if the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   x #!EF axis 
is selected from the cascade menu, you are able to move 
only the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   x #!EF projection in the 3-D cursor box. 
When cursor movement is constrained, the portion of the wire-frame box 
that corresponds to the selected axis is highlighted. To remove movement 
constraints on the cursors, select  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   None #!EF from the options 
menu. #!N #!N Constraining is useful for more precise positioning of 
the cursor. Note that exact positioning is not possible with the 
3-D cursor tool. #!N #!I30 #!N 5. Repeat the previous three 
steps for each probe icon in your visual program. #!N #!N 
Reexecute the visual program to implement the probes. #!N #!I0 #!N 
#!EF #!N #!N #!N While in  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Cursors #!EF mode, the 
center and right mouse buttons have the same functions as they 
do in  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Rotate #!EF mode. Note: You can also enable 
Probe (cursors) mode by using the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   intrctnMode #!EF parameter to 
the Image tool (see Image in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's 
Reference). #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N #!N  #!Lpickin,dxall322 h Using Pick  #!EL
