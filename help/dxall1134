#!N  #!Rall1133 Tiling Options #!N #!EC #!N #!N Tiling options are 
controlled by a set of Object attributes. These attributes may be 
associated with Objects at any level of a Field/Group hierarchy. The 
attributes may be set by using the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   DXSetAttribute() #!EF function, 
or by using the Options module. The attributes are: #!T,1,76,151  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*

is a method of resolving conflicts between objects at the same 
distance from the camera. For example, it may be desirable to 
define a set of lines coincident with a plane. Normally it 
will be unclear which object is to be displayed in front. 
In addition, single-pixel lines are inherently inaccurate (i.e. they deviate from 
the actual geometric line) by as much as one-half pixel; when 
displayed against a sloping surface, this  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   x #!EF or  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   
y #!EF inaccuracy is equivalent to a  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   z #!EF inaccuracy 
related to the slope of the surface. The "fuzz" attribute specifies 
a  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   z #!EF value that will be added to the 
object before it is compared with other objects in the scene, 
thus resolving this problem. The fuzz value is specified in pixels. 
For example, a fuzz value of one pixel can compensate for 
the described half-pixel inaccuracy when the line is displayed against a 
surface with a slope of two. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next
