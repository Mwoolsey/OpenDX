#!EC #!N #!N A Composite Field is another kind of Group 
that is treated as a single entity. For example, parallelism in 
Data Explorer is achieved by explicitly partitioning Fields into abutting, spatially 
disjoint primitive Fields. Positions on the boundaries must be replicated identically. 
Like Multigrid Groups, all members must have the same type of 
data and the same type of connections. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*
