#!N  #!Rtall703 DXNO_BACKING_STORE #!N if set to anything, disables framebuffer 
readbacks. Setting this environment variable will improve performance of interaction with 
hardware rendered images, especially for machines for which readback is slow. 
However, some of the interactions in the image window (such as 
zoom) will result in a black image while interaction is taking 
place. If you are not planning on using the Image tool, 
then it is strongly recommended that this environment variable be set. 
The default is that framebuffer readbacks are enabled. #!N #!N #!N
