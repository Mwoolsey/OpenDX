#!N  #!Rall1158 libDXcallm.a #!N #!EC To create your own stand-alone programs 
which call DX modules, as shown by the "DX Modules" layer 
in  #!Larch118,dxall984 f Figure 118  #!EL  , link your programs with the libDXcallm.a library. Because 
your program is the main routine and does not include any 
of the functions which are supplied by the Data Explorer Executive, 
you must do all object management, flow control (which modules to 
call when), any looping or conditional execution, and object deletion and 
reference count management. See  #!Ldxcmplu,dxall1177 h DXCallModule, DXModSet..., DXSetModule...  #!EL  for more information. #!N #!N If 
you are building a module to use with Data Explorer, you 
would link with this library if you wanted to use DXCallModule 
to use some of the Data Explorer modules from within your 
own program. In addition, some higher level processing functions such as 
interpolation support, is available only in libDXcallm.a. #!N #!N The routines 
contained in libDXcallm.a are listed in  #!Lallr,dxall1162 h Data Explorer Library Routines  #!EL  . #!N #!N #!N
