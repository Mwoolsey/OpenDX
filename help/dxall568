#!N #!EC #!N #!N If you find yourself "lost" in the 
Image window; for example, you have a black picture and don't 
know where your data object is, you can always "reset the 
camera" by using the Reset Camera option in the View Control 
dialog box of the Image window. This zooms out so that 
you can see  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   all #!EF of your object, from a 
"front and center" view. #!N #!N It is also often helpful 
to use ShowBox to display the bounding box of your entire 
data set. Collect this with the rest of your visualization, and 
then you will be able to see how the part you 
are looking at relates to the entire data set. #!N #!N
