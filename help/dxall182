Explorer is designed as a client-server model. The Data Explorer client-server 
architecture incorporates system components such as TCP/IP, sockets, X Window System, 
and Motif. #!N #!N In this client-server model, the user interface 
is the client. The executive, modules, and data management components, often 
referred to collectively as the executive, make up the server portion. 
The user interface client can be on a different platform from 
the server (executive), and the executive can run on multiple platforms 
simultaneously (distributed processing). Data Explorer allows you to switch among servers 
running on different hardware platforms. #!N #!N The Data Explorer system 
can be thought of as consisting of four "layers," each with 
its own defined interface. These layers are described in the order 
in which you are likely to encounter them: #!N #!I0 #!N
