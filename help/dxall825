#!N 1. For hardware rendering, when specifying "dots" for "rendering approximation," 
lines are drawn in their entirety, whereas for software rendering only 
the line end points are drawn. The "render every" and "wire" 
approximations are available only with hardware rendering. When the "box" approximation 
is specified, hardware rendering will show the bounding box of each 
field in the rendered object, while software rendering will show only 
the bounding box of the entire object. #!N #!I30 #!N 2. 
Some graphics adapters do not support clipping. On such adapters, "ClipBox" 
and "ClipPlane" have no effect. #!N #!I30 #!N 3. For some 
hardware platforms, surfaces specified with opacities are rendered by the hardware 
as screen-door surfaces (i.e., every other pixel is drawn, letting the 
background show through). This allows only one level of opacity and 
completely obscures a semi-opaque surface that is behind another semi-opaque surface. 
The transparency effect is hardware dependent, and can produce a completely 
opaque or completely transparent appearance. True transparency is supported for OpenGL 
platforms. #!N #!I30 #!N 4. The image displayed by the hardware 
rendering can be different from the image produced by the software 
rendering. This is a result of several differences in rendering techniques. 
The hardware rendering does not provide gamma correction, causing images to 
be slightly darker. Normals are not reversed when viewing the "inside" 
of a surface, with the result that lighting effects are much 
dimmer on the "inside" of a surface. Attributes applied to the 
"inside" of a surface (e.g., "back colors") are ignored. #!N #!I30 
#!N 5. When using hardware rendering, the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   where #!EF parameter 
to Display cannot specify a host other than the one on 
which the Display module is running. However, it can specify a 
different display attached to the same host. #!N #!I30 #!N 6. 
The hardware renderer does not duplicate the "dense emitter" model used 
by the software renderer for rendering volumes. Only the data values 
at the boundary of the volume are rendered, producing the appearance 
of a transparent boundary of the volume. #!N #!I30 #!N 7. 
For hardware rendering, a wireframe rendering approximation is not intended to 
produce the same visual results as ShowConnections. #!N #!I30 #!N 8. 
Hardware rendering handles colors between 0.0 and 1.0. If colors are 
outside this range, each color channel is independently clamped, before lighting 
is applied. In software rendering, clamping is done after lighting is 
applied. #!N #!I30 #!N 9. Hardware rendering does not support view 
angles of less than 0.001 degree. #!N #!I30 #!N 10. Anti-aliasing 
and multiple pixels width lines is only available in hardware rendering.
