for use in the Data Explorer VPE or Scripting Language #!N 
#!EC #!N #!N If you want to write a module to 
use in the Data Explorer Visual Program Editor, or in the 
scripting language, you will probably use the libDXlite.a library. This library 
contains all of the Data Explorer data model routines which allow 
you to query, manipulate, and create data model objects. Much of 
this reference book concerns this common use of the Data Explorer 
library routines. You should be familiar with the material in  #!Ldatachp,dxall1061 h Working with Data Model Objects  #!EL  
, which discusses how to use the Data Explorer data model 
routines. You may also want to incorporate one or more of 
the existing Data Explorer modules into your own module, or use 
some of the high level data processing functions, such as interpolation. 
In this case you would need to use the libDXcallm.a library. 
DXCallModule is discussed in  #!Lmodacss,dxall1113 h Module Access  #!EL  . #!N #!N  #!Lwritmod,dxall989 h Writing a Simple Module  #!EL  through  #!Lmtds,dxall1045 h Making a Module Work  #!EL  
show you a number of examples of modules, including import filters 
and various data manipulation modules. These examples are supported by .c 
files and makefiles in /usr/lpp/dx/samples/program_guide. If you wish to incorporate routines 
from the libDXcallm.a library, simply change the makefiles to link to 
this library instead of to libDXlite.a. All of the routines in 
libDXcallm.a are described in  #!Lallr,dxall1162 h Data Explorer Library Routines  #!EL  , while the subset of routines 
available in libDXlite.a is listed in  #!Ldxlap1,dxall1161 h Data Explorer Data Model Library: DXlite Routines  #!EL  . When you write 
a module for use in Data Explorer, the Data Explorer Executive 
is still the process which "owns main." Your module is simply 
incorporated into Data Explorer. Your module can be directly built in 
to the Data Explorer Executive (inboard module), run as a separate 
process (outboard module), or loaded into the Data Explorer executive at 
runtime (runtime-loadable module). Each of these is discussed in  #!Lmtds,dxall1045 h Making a Module Work  #!EL  . 
Using runtime-loadable modules is in general the preferred option. #!N #!N
