#!EC #!N #!N Video production is only one useful output from 
a Data Explorer visual program. Videotape has the advantage of portability: 
you can send a video to almost anyone these days because 
of the proliferation of consumer VCRs. But video has the great 
disadvantage that you can no longer make interactive changes in the 
images: you cannot "explore" any more once you have committed your 
images to videotape. #!N #!N Unfortunately, high-definition digital television is not 
widely available yet. It is very important to be aware of 
the technical limitations of standard analog television, especially as it differs 
from workstation monitors. #!N #!N The two biggest problems encountered in 
moving images created on a high-resolution workstation to a consumer television 
(monitor or VCR) are the loss of resolution and the inability 
of consumer TV to accurately render color. (These remarks are basically 
true for both the American NTSC TV system and the European 
PAL system. This is not meant to be a technical description 
of either system.) #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N
