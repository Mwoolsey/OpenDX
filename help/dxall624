Overview of the Native File Format #!N #!EC #!N #!N A 
Data Explorer file consists of a header section followed by an 
optional data section. The header section consists of a textual description 
of a collection of Objects. The data section contains the Array 
Object data, either as text or in binary, and is referred 
to by the header section. A header section can refer to 
Objects and data either in the current file or in other 
files. #!N #!N  #!Ldefex1102,dxall624 f Figure 102  #!EL  shows data imbedded in its header. Another 
file cannot refer to data in this file because there is 
no specified data section. However, header sections in this file can 
refer to data sections in other files. This method is sometimes 
more convenient when creating data files with simple programs. #!N #!N 
 #!Ldefex2103,dxall624 f Figure 103  #!EL  shows a header section referring to a data section in 
another file. The header refers to the data using the data 
file name and an offset location (in bytes from the beginning 
of the data section) in the file. #!N #!N  #!Ldefex3104,dxall624 f Figure 104  #!EL  shows 
a header section and data section in the same file. The 
header refers to the data section using a byte offset, relative 
to the start of the data section. #!Cbrown #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--18*    #!Rdefex1102

File #!EF #!N #!EC #!N #!N These configurations can be used 
in conjunction with each other. For example, a file can contain 
both a header and data and can refer to data both 
in the same file and in another file. A file can 
also have only a header and refer to data in either 
a data-only file or in a file that contains both a 
header and data. This flexibility allows you to construct a header 
that points to data in existing files, and lets you view 
and edit the header information (if necessary), using standard tools. #!N 
#!N The following examples illustrate some of the ways you can 
import data using the Data Explorer native file format. You may
