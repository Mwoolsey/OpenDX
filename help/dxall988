#!CNavyBlue #!N  #!Rall987 Controlling the Data Explorer Executive or 
User Interface from a Separate Program #!N #!EC #!N #!N You 
may want to write a program which controls the Data Explorer 
Executive. For example, you could write your own user interface, providing 
a custom "look and feel," and send Data Explorer script language 
commands to the Data Explorer executive. In this case you would 
get all of the functionality provided by the executive (cache management, 
control of execution order, and object management). You could also directly 
control the Data Explorer User Interface from a separate program, loading 
and executing visual programs. For example, you may wish to fire 
up Data Explorer with a "canned" visualization program once a simulation 
is complete, with parameters within the visual program preset to particular 
values. #!N #!N Graphically, both of these are represented by the 
upper "User Program" in  #!Larch118,dxall984 f Figure 118  #!EL  , which controls the Data Explorer 
Executive or User Interface from the user's program. The libDXL.a library 
(DXLink) provides this functionality, and is discussed in  #!Ldxlink,dxall1141 h DXLink Developer's Toolkit  #!EL  . Examples 
of DXLink programs can be found in /usr/lpp/dx/samples/dxlink. #!N #!N With 
the functionality provided by SuperviseWindow and SuperviseState (see  #!Lsupwind,dxall961 h SuperviseWindow  #!EL  and  #!Lsupstat,dxall958 h SuperviseState  #!EL  
in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference), your program does not 
need the Image tool (which is provided only within the Data 
Explorer User Interface) in order to provide direct user interaction in 
the image window. Thus a custom GUI communicating only with the 
Data Explorer Executive can implement all of the user-interaction provided by 
the Data Explorer User Interface. Examples of custom direct interactors can 
be found in /usr/lpp/dx/samples/supervise; while these examples are demonstrated using the 
Data Explorer User Interface, there is no necessity that they do 
so, as all of the modules used in these examples (SuperviseWindow, 
SuperviseState, and Display, in particular) are available directly from the Data 
Explorer Executive. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF #!N #!N
