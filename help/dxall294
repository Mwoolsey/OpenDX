#!N After you set up a visual program in the VPE 
window and build any desired Control Panels (or after you open 
an existing visual program file), you can execute the visual program 
program. The resulting image appears in the Image window. This section 
explains how to execute a visual program. Section  #!Luseimag,dxall299 h Using the Image Window  #!EL  describes how 
to manipulate images in the Image window by using direct interactors. 
You can also manipulate images in the Image window using interactors 
in the Control Panels, the Colormap Editor, and the Sequencer. (For 
more information on these tools, see  #!Lbuico,dxall380 h Using Control Panels and Interactors  #!EL  ,  #!Lcolrmap,dxall794 h Colormap  #!EL  , and 
 #!Lsequenc,dxall939 h Sequencer  #!EL  in IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's Reference.) #!N #!N You 
can execute the visual program from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute #!EF menu 
of a VPE window, a Control Panel, an Image window, or 
a Message window. The options are the same in all four 
windows. When a visual program is executed, an Image window is 
created if one is not already open. (You can also control 
execution using the Execute module. See IBM Visualization Data Explorer User's 
Reference.) #!N Note: If the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute #!EF options are grayed-out, 
your workstation may not be connected to the server. For information 
about connecting to the server, see  #!Lconserv,dxall493 h Connecting to the Server  #!EL  . #!N Although you 
can initiate execution from the Control Panel, VPE, Image, and Message 
windows, you may find it more efficient to execute your visual 
program through the Control Panel menu (if you are using a 
Control Panel). This efficiency is due to the ease with which 
you can change inputs with interactors and initiate execution. #!N #!N 
You can choose one of four options from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute 
#!EF menu when executing a visual program. Select the first option, 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute Once #!EF , to execute the program once, using 
the values currently set in the interactors. If you change any 
interactor values after execution, the visual program does not automatically execute; 
you must again choose an option from the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute #!EF 
menu to execute the altered program. #!N #!N Choosing the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   
Execute on Change #!EF option causes the visual program to execute 
every time you change an interactor setting. If you change values 
faster than Data Explorer can generate images, the system executes the 
program as quickly as possible, always using the current settings at 
the time an execution cycle begins. If you modify your visual 
program while  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute on Change #!EF is enabled, then the 
option automatically becomes disabled. After the changes are made, you can 
reenable it. #!N #!N Choosing  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   End Execution #!EF while the 
visual program is executing causes execution to stop after the currently 
executing module. #!N #!N The final  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute #!EF menu option 
is  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Sequencer #!EF . If you select this option, and 
a Sequencer tool is present in the visual program, the Sequencer 
appears (see  #!Lsequen,dxall295 h Using the Sequencer  #!EL  for more information). While the Sequencer runs, you 
can change interactor settings, and those changes are reflected in subsequent 
frames generated by the Sequencer. The  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute Once #!EF and 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute on Change #!EF options are grayed out when the 
Sequencer is running, but when you pause the Sequencer, you can 
use those two options to explore the particular frame the Sequencer 
paused on. #!N #!N While the visual program is executing, the 
 #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute #!EF option on the menu bar is highlighted. It 
remains highlighted until execution is finished. If  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute on Change 
#!EF is selected, the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Execute #!EF option on the menu 
bar is highlighted with one color during execution, and another color 
outside of execution cycles. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF
