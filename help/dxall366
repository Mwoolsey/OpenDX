#!N #!N The Colormap Editor specifies color in the hue, saturation, 
and value (HSV) color space.  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Hue #!EF refers to the 
color, for example, blue, red or yellow. The range of the 
hue goes from red to green to blue back to red 
again.  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Saturation #!EF refers to the purity of the color, 
and is a value between 0 and 1. A saturation of 
1 is pure color; as saturation decreases, the color becomes more 
pastel, becoming white when saturation is 0.  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Value #!EF is 
the brightness of the color, and is a value between 0 
to 1. A value of 1 is maximum brightness; as value 
decreases, the color becomes darker, becoming black when value is 0. 
#!N #!N For a thorough understanding of color and the color 
elements of hue, saturation, value, and opacity, and other elements of 
computer graphics that might relate to the Colormap characteristics, you may 
want to refer to a computer graphics text. #!N #!N You 
can display the Colormap Editor by selecting the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Open All 
Colormap Editors #!EF option on the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Windows #!EF menu of 
the Image window or by double-clicking on the Colormap tool in 
the VPE window. The Colormap Editor displays default settings for each 
of the three HSV color space parameters, as shown in the 
first three boxed areas on the right hand side of the 
window. These three areas, labeled  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Hue #!EF ,  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Saturation 
#!EF , and  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Value #!EF , each work independently of 
one another. As you change their values, the RGB boxed area 
at the left of the window changes automatically to correspond. #!N 
#!N The  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Opacity #!EF area, located on the far right 
hand side of the Colormap Editor window, works in a similar 
way. As you make changes in the opacity area, the background 
bar (located to the right of the RGB bar) reflects your 
work. It shows your adjustments to the opacity of the image 
in relation to the background colors. By default, the background bar 
appears as two vertical stripes. However, if it is easier for 
you to judge the colors of the image and background with 
a checkerboard-style bar, select the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Set Background Style to Checkboard 
#!EF option on the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   Options #!EF menu (see  #!Lcmapom,dxall468 h Colormap Options Menu  #!EL  ). 
#!N #!N In order to perform certain operations on an area, 
it must be selected. To select an area either click on 
the area's label or click in the area itself. Only one 
area can be selected at a time. When an area is 
selected, its label is depressed. #!N #!N The range of data 
values onto which HSV and opacity values are mapped is controlled 
by the  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   min #!EF and  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   max #!EF fields located 
near the bottom and top of the Colormap Editor window. By 
default,  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   min #!EF is set to 0, and  #!F-adobe-times-bold-r-normal--18*   max 
#!EF is set to 100. You can change this range to 
values more appropriate for your data by clicking on either field, 
typing the new value, and pressing the Enter key. #!N #!N 
Control points are used to define the value of hue, saturation, 
value, and opacity for a given data value. The number and 
position of control points can be different in each of the 
areas. The control points appear as small squares on the vertical 
scale marks in each of the four areas. #!N #!N #!N
