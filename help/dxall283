Explorer Windows #!N #!EC #!N #!N The Data Explorer user interface 
is built on the X Window System and Motif standards. These 
tools manage the windows used with Data Explorer. The windows you 
use depends upon how you choose to use the system. #!N 
#!N The primary windows are listed and described at the start 
of this chapter. The primary window in which you begin a 
Data Explorer session (either the Visual Program Editor or Image window) 
is called the  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   anchor window #!EF . (You can also 
have a menu bar as your anchor window by specifying -menubar 
on the command line.) This is the window that, if closed, 
ends the Data Explorer session. The anchor window is identified by 
a symbol resembling a ship's anchor located in the top left 
corner, as illustrated in  #!Luse249,dxall284 f Figure 49  #!EL  . #!N #!N Descriptions of the 
primary window pull-down menu options are located in Section  #!Lprimwin,dxall441 h Using the Primary Window Pull-Down Menus and Options  #!EL  . 
#!N #!N Secondary windows, such as dialog boxes or informational boxes, 
appear when they are needed to complete a task. You can 
move secondary windows, but you cannot put them behind the primary 
window from which they came. See IBM AIXwindows User's Guide or 
the appropriate window system overview for more information on how to 
manipulate windows. #!N #!N In this chapter, when references are made 
to the X Window System it means any window server that 
supports X11 protocol, including Sun's OpenWindows. The Motif window manger, mwm, 
has been used in many figures and examples in this chapter. 
Please use the appropriate window manager for your system, such as 
vuewm for Hewlett-Packard, 4dwm for SGI, and olwm for Sun. Since 
title bars and window borders are features of a window manager, 
the appearance of your windows may differ slightly from those in 
the figures and examples. #!N #!N #!N  #!F-adobe-times-medium-i-normal--18*   Next Topic #!EF
