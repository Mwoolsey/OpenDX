<H2><A NAME="HDRBUICO" ></A>7.1 Using Control Panels and Interactors
</H2>
<P>
As you create a visual program, you may have inputs whose values are subject to
frequent change.
You can use interactors as an easy method for controlling those input
values.
<I>Interactors</I>, which appear only in Control Panels, are the
interactive devices that you use to manipulate inputs to a visual program
in order to change the image that is produced (see
<A HREF="#HDRINTERAC">"Using Interactors"</A> for detailed descriptions).
<A NAME="IDX765"></A>
<P>
<I>Interactor stand-ins</I> are used to indicate which input to a
module a given interactor is to control.
While you are building the network in the VPE, you select interactor
stand-ins from the tool palettes and place them on the canvas,
as you do with other tools.
Like any tool, the output of an interactor stand-in can be connected to
more than one input.
Interactor stand-ins are named, in general, after the type of data they
output&#58;

Data Explorer allows the visual programmer to associate comments with each
Control Panel.
To access these comments, use the <TT><STRONG>On Control Panel</STRONG></TT>
option of
the <TT><STRONG>Help</STRONG></TT> pull-down menu in the Control Panel about
which you want to learn.
If no comments exist for the Control Panel, the <TT><STRONG>On Control

The menu bar, discussed in <A HREF="usrgu045.htm#HDRCPMENU">"Control Panel Menu
Bar"</A>, contains categories of
available menu options.
The open area is called the <I>layout area</I>.
<P>
You can create any number of Control Panels for one visual program, and you can
also place a single interactor in multiple Control Panels.
The configuration of a Control Panel and the values of the interactors
are saved when you save the visual program.
You can also customize Control Panels, and save or restore them
independently of the visual program.
<P>
If you are going to control a tool input through an interactor in a
Control Panel, then you must first connect an interactor stand-in
to that input in the VPE.
Using a stand-in as a tool input is an alternative to using the
module&#39;s Configuration dialog box every time you want to
change the value of the input.

To place interactors in a new Control Panel&#58;
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>On the VPE canvas, select the interactor stand-ins you want in
the Control Panel (other tools can be selected as well).
<LI>Click on the <TT><STRONG>New Control Panel</STRONG></TT> option of the
<TT><STRONG>Windows</STRONG></TT> menu.
This causes a new Control Panel to appear with the selected interactors
in the layout area.
Each interactor is labeled with the name of the tool to which its output
is connected, unless its output is connected to more than one tool or
not connected to any tool, in which case the interactor is labeled
with the interactor type (e.g., an integer interactor is labeled
with "Integer").
You can also double-click on one of the selected interactor stand-ins to
create a new Control Panel automatically.
</OL>
<P>
When a new Control Panel is created with the selected interactors, the
interactors are placed in a vertical column in the order in which
their stand-ins were placed on the VPE canvas.
<P><B>Note: </B>If you select a group that includes tools other than interactor
stand-ins, only the interactors appear in the Control Panel.
Therefore, the quickest way to place all the visual program&#39;s interactors in
one Control Panel is to use the <TT><STRONG>Select All</STRONG></TT> option of
the
<TT><STRONG>Edit</STRONG></TT> pull-down, then select the <TT><STRONG>New
Control
Panel</STRONG></TT> option of the <TT><STRONG>Windows</STRONG></TT> pull-down

To add an interactor to an existing Control Panel&#58;
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>Open the Control Panel.
<LI>Select the interactor stand-in on the VPE canvas.
<LI>In the Control Panel window, click on the <TT><STRONG>Add Selected
Interactor(s)</STRONG></TT> option of the <TT><STRONG>Edit</STRONG></TT> menu.
<LI>Move the cursor to where you want to position the tool in the
Control Panel.
Note that the style of the cursor changes when you move it onto the
panel.
This is similar to how tool icons are placed on the VPE canvas.
Exact placement of the interactor depends on the grid settings (see
<A HREF="#HDRCCPGRID">"Changing the Alignment of Interactors in the Control
Panel"</A>).
<LI>Click the mouse.
The interactor appears at the specified location.
</OL>
<P>
Alternatively, you can use "drag and drop" to add an interactor
to an existing Control Panel:
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>Select the interactor stand-in on the VPE canvas.
<LI>Press the middle mouse button while the cursor is positioned on the
stand-in icon.
<LI>Drag the cursor to the Control Panel and release the mouse button.
<LI>The interactor appears at the new location.
</OL>
<P>
You can add more than one interactor at a time to a Control Panel.
To do this, select multiple interactor stand-ins on the VPE canvas,
then select <TT><STRONG>Add Selected Interactor(s)</STRONG></TT> in the desired
Control Panel.
After doing this, you can use the mouse to place the interactors in the
Control Panel one at a time.
They are placed in the Control Panel in the same order that they were
placed initially onto the VPE canvas.
Similarly, you can drag and drop multiple stand-ins from the visual program
to a Control Panel.
You can also drag and drop interactors from one Control Panel to
another, as long as both are associated with the same Data Explorer
session.
For more information on drag and drop, see <A
HREF="usrgu041.htm#HDRMACTS">"Moving and Copying Tools"</A>.
<P>
You can put the same interactor in more than one Control Panel and in
the same Control Panel more than once.
For example, you may want to have one Control Panel that contains
<I>all</I> the interactors for a visual program, and another that
contains only the most frequently used interactors.
You can also place multiple instances of an interactor, with different
styles or step size increments, in one Control Panel.
This provides both coarse and fine control over a parameter value.
The user interface ensures that each instance of the interactor
is consistent.
If you change a value in one instance, it changes in the others.

You can have several instances of the same interactor.
Each instance can be a different style (stepper, dial, or slider) and
can have a different increment value.
However, all instances of an interactor have the same value and the same

The Set Attributes dialog box for the <TT><STRONG>Selector</STRONG></TT> and
<TT><STRONG>SelectorList</STRONG></TT> interactors (<A HREF="#FIGSELATT">Figure

differ from the dialog box for other types of interactors
because the behavior of those interactors is different from
other types of interactors.
<P>
The Selector and SelectorList interactors are similar to an option menu,
with the current choice(s) displayed by the interactor.
(The Selector offers a one-of-many choice; the SelectorList, a choice of
none, one, or more among many.)
Each choice on the interactor represents a pair of outputs: a value and
a string.
The string is what appears as the choice on the interactor.
The value can be a string, integer, scalar, vector or matrix.
All the values must be of the same type.
By default, the values are integers.
A value is associated with a string using the
<TT><STRONG>Set Attributes...</STRONG></TT> dialog box
(<A HREF="#FIGSELATT">Figure 62</A>).

<P>
You can use the Selector or SelectorList interactor for many purposes.
A common use is as a switch control in your visual program.
You can use an integer output, for example, as input to the Switch
module to switch easily among several objects.
You can use a string output, for example, as input to the Select or
Import modules, allowing you to easily select different members
or data file names.
You can also use a string output as input to the Caption module to
annotate the image with the current selector setting.
A discussion on how to use the Selector and
SelectorList interactors can be found in
<A HREF="#HDRSELINT">"Selector and SelectorList Interactors"</A>.
<P>
The default choices for the Selector and SelectorList interactors are:

It is possible to customize Control Panels so that they appear as
dialog boxes.
This is intended for building applications to be used in
<TT>-image</TT> or
<TT>-menubar</TT> mode
(i.e., with the Image window or menu bar
as the anchor window).
The appearance of the dialog box can be modified with the options
<TT><STRONG>Label</STRONG></TT> and <TT><STRONG>Separator</STRONG></TT>
under <TT><STRONG>Add Element</STRONG></TT> in the
<TT><STRONG>Edit</STRONG></TT> pull-down menu
of the Control Panel.
These will add the specified element to the panel at the point where
the mouse cursor is positioned.
Separators can be made vertical using the <TT><STRONG>Set Layout</STRONG></TT>
option
of the <TT><STRONG>Edit</STRONG></TT> menu.
The size of the separator can be controlled using the mechanism
described in <A HREF="#HDRRESZINT">"Resizable Interactors."</A>.
The color and font of labels can be specified using the dialog box that
appears when the label is created.
These can be changed by selecting the label and choosing
<TT><STRONG>Set Attributes</STRONG></TT> from the
<TT><STRONG>Edit</STRONG></TT> menu of the Control Panel.
<P>
Once the Control Panel has been created, select
<TT><STRONG>Dialog

in the <TT><STRONG>Options</STRONG></TT> pull-down menu to create the dialog
box.
The size of the box will vary to accommodate the interactors.
The empty canvas to the right of the interactors will be truncated.
The placement of the interactors will also change if the box size is
changed, to maintain the same relative positions.
In <TT>-editor</TT> mode, the <TT><STRONG>Close</STRONG></TT> button returns
to an editable Control Panel.
In <TT>-image</TT> or

<P>
You may wish to organize your Control Panels into groups or hierarchies
depending on how the interactors in the Control Panels relate.
For example, you may have a few Control Panels that are tightly related
and wish to have them treated as a group.
Data Explorer provides you with the means of placing these Control Panels into a
group so that they can be opened together.
<P>
If you have a master Control Panel that should be open before any other
controls, Data Explorer provides you with the capability of restricting
access to these Control Panels from any Data Explorer window except
the master Control Panel.
Access to Control Panel groups can be done in a similar fashion.
Restricting access to Control Panels in this way allows you to build
Control Panels into hierarchical structures.
<P>
A special type of Control Panel access can be achieved by specifying
which Control Panels are automatically opened when Data Explorer is started

<P>
The vector stand-in has two styles of interactor; a stepper style and
a text style.
The Vector interactor works like one, two, or
three Steppers stacked in a column.
With it, you can specify the components of a vector (e.g,
x, y, and z) from top to bottom.
See <A HREF="#HDRSTEPER">"Stepper"</A> for detailed information on the operation
of a
Stepper.
You can also change the dimensionality of the interactor using the
<TT><STRONG>Edit</STRONG></TT> menu <TT><STRONG>Set Dimensionality</STRONG></TT>
option.
The text style vector interactor is similar to that of the value
interactor.

Data Explorer provides six types of list stand-ins and interactors:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Integer
<LI>Scalar
<LI>Selector
<LI>Vector
<LI>String
<LI>Value
</UL>
<P>
With the exception of Selector, these list interactors can have two
styles: list-editor and text.
The text-style list interactor is similar to that of the value
interactor.

		<P>
The list-editor style list interactors consist of the following parts:

		<UL>
			<LI>Title

			<LI>List of values

			<LI>Pushbuttons for adding and deleting elements

			<LI>A single stepper (for integer and scalar lists), three steppers
(for a vector list), or a text field (for string and value lists).

		</UL>
		<A HREF="#FIGVECLIST">Figure 71</A> shows an example of a Vector list
interactor.
For the SelectorList interactor, see <A HREF="#HDRSELINT">"Selector and
SelectorList Interactors"</A>.

The Selector interactor (<A HREF="#FIGSELECT">Figure 72</A>.) can be used as a
switch
control in a visual program.
<A NAME="IDX812"></A>
It can appear as an option menu (with only the current choice shown) or
as a "radio button" interactor, with all possible choices shown,
and only the current choice highlighted in the radio button
next to the label.
The SelectorList interactor always appears as a list of toggle buttons.

for your visual program, and also describes its various uses.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRFSELINT"></A><U>FileSelector Interactor</U></H4>
<P>
The FileSelector interactor can be used to select a file from within
the file system (<A HREF="#FIGFSELINT">Figure 73</A>).
<P><B><A NAME="FIGFSELINT" HREF="../usrguide.htm#FT_FIGFSELINT">Figure 73.
FileSelector Interactor</A></B><BR>
<B><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/flselint.gif" ALT="Figure flselint not

<P>
The interactor consists of a text field containing a string and a
button labelled with an ellipses.
Clicking on the button causes a file selection dialog box to be opened.
The file selection dialog box, illustrated in <A HREF="#FIGFILESB">Figure
74</A>,
functions in a similar manner to other file selection dialog boxes (for
a description on how to use file selection dialog boxes see
<A HREF="usrgu041.htm#HDRSAVERVP">"Saving and Restoring a Visual Program"</A>)
with the exception of the buttons at
the bottom of the dialog box.
<P><B><A NAME="FIGFILESB" HREF="../usrguide.htm#FT_FIGFILESB">Figure 74. File

<P>
<TT><STRONG>OK</STRONG></TT> causes the file name in the Selection area to be
set in the text field of the FileSelector interactor and closes the file
selection dialog box.
<TT><STRONG>Filter</STRONG></TT> applies the filter string specified in the
Filter area.
<TT><STRONG>Close</STRONG></TT> closes the file selection dialog box without
any modification to the FileSelector interactor text field.
<TT><STRONG>Apply</STRONG></TT> causes the file name in the Selection area to be
set
in the text field of the FileSelector interactor and leaves the
file selection dialog box open.
<P>
An alternate way of specifying or modifying a file name in the
FileSelector text field is to directly type into the field.
See <A HREF="usrgu037.htm#HDREDTXT">"Editing Text Fields"</A> on how to enter
and modify text in a text field.
<P>
The FileSelector interactor produces two outputs: the first output is
the contents of the text field (typically a fully qualified path
name set from the file selection dialog box).
The second output is the name of the file as it appears in the
directory (that is, excluding any directory name).
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRRSETINT"></A><U>Reset Interactor</U></H4>
<A NAME="IDX813"></A>
<A NAME="IDX814"></A>
The Reset interactor outputs one value for the first execution after
its toggle is set, and a different value thereafter.
This interactor appears only as a toggle button.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="HDRTOGLINT"></A><U>Toggle Interactor</U></H4>
<A NAME="IDX815"></A>
<A NAME="IDX816"></A>
<P>
The Toggle interactor outputs one of two
possible values.
The values can be strings, scalars, vectors, or matrices.
This interactor appears only as a toggle button.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRDDINTER" ></A>Using Data-Driven Interactors</H3>
<A NAME="IDX817"></A>
<P>
Most of the interactor types may be <I>data-driven</I>, meaning
that their attributes, such as minimum, maximum, increment, and
label, may be set by connecting the output of a tool to the
input of the interactor stand-in in the VPE or by a
value typed into the interactor stand-in&#39;s
Configuration dialog box, rather than by
using the <TT><STRONG>Set Attributes</STRONG></TT>
dialog box for the interactor.
<P>
If an interactor is data-driven, then the information transmitted via
connections or set in the Configuration dialog box overrides the
values set via the <TT><STRONG>Set Attributes</STRONG></TT> dialog box
and causes
the corresponding values in the <TT><STRONG>Set Attributes</STRONG></TT>
dialog box to be grayed out.
<P>
Data-driven interactors allow you to create visual programs that will
work with a variety of input data sets without the need to reset the
interactor attributes to be in a range appropriate for the data
being used.
For example, a scalar interactor controlling an isosurface value can be
data-driven by connecting the input data field to it.
The interactor is then automatically set so that its minimum and
maximum span the range of the data.
<P>
Data-driven interactors have a data input to which an input data field
may be connected.
In this case the interactor automatically chooses the minimum, maximum,
and increment.
However, if you would like to have more control over the exact values
that are used, the interactors allow you to specify them directly
through other input tabs that are by default hidden.
For example, you may wish to set the minimum and maximum for an
interactor to go from the minimum of the data values to the
midpoint of the data values, rather than to the maximum.
In this case, you can use the "min" and "max" input tabs of
the interactor rather than the "data" tab.
<P>
The interactors that can be data-driven are
Integer,
Scalar,
Vector,
IntegerList,
ScalarList,
VectorList,
Selector,
SelectorList, and
Toggle.
In <A HREF="refgu009.htm#HDRFMD">Chapter 2.  Functional Modules</A> in <I>IBM
Visualization Data Explorer User&#39;s Reference</I>,
the inputs for each of these interactors are described on the manual
page corresponding to that interactor.
<P>
Each time an input to a data-driven interactor is changed (for example,
by importing a new data set) the interactor is reexecuted, updating
its attributes.
If the current setting of the interactor lies within the new range
allowed, the interactor value does not change.
If the current setting is outside the new allowed range, the current
setting is reset to the midpoint of the new minimum and maximum.
