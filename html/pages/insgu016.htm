<H2><A NAME="HDRHPCFG" HREF="insgu014.htm#PToC_23">8.3 Configuring a Data
Explorer License for an HP Workstation</A></H2>
<P>Data Explorer uses the NetLS licensing system from Gradient Technologies,
Inc.,
to manage the two types of licenses available with Data Explorer:
<TABLE CELLPADDING="3">
<TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B>Node-locked license
</B></TD><TD><P>This license program is restricted to the machine
matching the node identifier for which a license was acquired. All
version 1 basic one-time charge licenses are considered node-locked
licenses. Please note that this type of license does NOT require the
installation of the NetLS license server software included with Data Explorer.
</TD></TR><TR VALIGN="TOP"><TD><P><B>Floating (or concurrent use) license
</B></TD><TD><P>This license can be used by any
supported workstation on the network as long as the maximum number of
concurrent Data Explorer users does not exceed the number of purchased floating
licenses. Floating (or concurrent use) license installations require
that a NetLS license server run somewhere in the network. If your
network does not currently run a license server, see <A
HREF="insgu032.htm#HDRNETLS">Chapter 15. "Installing a NetLS License
Server"</A>.
Under a floating license, IBM waives the requirement
that customers notify IBM of change in designated machine. When this
program does not operate under the control of NetLS, normal customer
notification of change in designated machine rules apply. For more
information on the licensing software, please refer to the Gradient
documentation that is provided with the Data Explorer installation kit.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Both node-locked and floating licenses require that IBM be provided with
a unique workstation identifier. Identifiers are generated by the NodeID
script located in the bin directory of the Data Explorer installation directory
tree (e.g. <TT>/usr/local/dx/bin/NodeID</TT>). This identifier is
provided at the end of a successful installation. License type specifics
are covered in the following sections.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_24" HREF="insgu014.htm#PToC_24">Setting up a Node-locked
License for an HP Workstation</A></H3>
<P>To enable Data Explorer with a node-locked license:
<OL>
<P><LI>Be sure that Data Explorer is installed.
<P><LI>Obtain a node identifier by executing the <TT>NodeID</TT> script
found in the bin directory of the Data Explorer install tree (e.g.
<TT>/usr/local/dx/bin/NodeID</TT>) on the machine being licensed to run
Data Explorer. Note that the NodeID information is provided after a successful
installation of Data Explorer.
<P><LI>Call IBM Software Registration at 1-800-446-8989 (Monday-Friday,
6AM-5PM Mountain Time) from within the continental United States, call
1-800-565-SW4U in Canada, or call your IBM representative elsewhere, and
provide the information obtained in step 2 to receive your node-locked
"Vendor ID" and "Product Password".
</OL>
<P>
For the HP-UX operating system both the Vendor ID and the Product Password
must be placed in the file:
<PRE>
/usr/netls/nodelock
</PRE>
<P>
The Vendor ID and the Product Password must appear on the same line with
the Vendor ID placed first and a space between them. For example,
<PRE>
543b0f87c093.02.81.87.92.34.00.00.00 gganccupqb5d8auxabdws2a
</PRE>
<P>
Additional information on editing the <TT>nodelock</TT> file can be
found on page 31 of Gradient's <CITE>Managing Software Products with the
Network License System</CITE> included with your Data Explorer package.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_25" HREF="insgu014.htm#PToC_25">Setting up a Concurrent
License for an HP Workstation</A></H3>
<P><B>Note: </B>You should refer to the section <A
HREF="insgu035.htm#HDRHPLIFL">"Floating License Issues on an HP Workstation"</A>
before continuing with this section.
<P>
To set up a floating (or concurrent use) license, you must have a
license server running within your network. If you do not have a license
server running, see <A HREF="insgu032.htm#HDRNETLS">Chapter 15. "Installing a
NetLS License Server"</A>.
<P>
Once you have a NetLS license server running within your network, you
should:
<OL>
<P><LI>Be sure that Data Explorer is installed.
<P><LI>On your license server host run the <TT>NodeID</TT> script located
in the bin directory of the Data Explorer install tree (e.g.
<TT>/usr/local/dx/bin/NodeID</TT>).
Note that the NodeID information is provided after a successful
installation of Data Explorer.
<P><LI>Call IBM Software Registration at 1-800-446-8989 (Monday-Friday,
6AM-5PM Mountain Time) from within the continental United States, call
1-800-565-SW4U in Canada, or call your IBM representative elsewhere, and
provide the information returned in step 2 to receive your concurrent
license password information.
<P><LI>Enter this information in the license server database using the
ls_admin tool provided with the NetLS license server software. See
Gradient Technologies, Inc. documentation provided with Data Explorer for more
information regarding concurrent licensing issues. Page 21 of the
Gradient document entitled "Managing Software Products with the Network
License System" contains an example session using <TT>ls_admin</TT>.
