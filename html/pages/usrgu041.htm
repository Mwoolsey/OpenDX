A visual program is a collection of interconnected tools that acts upon one or
more inputs to create one or more outputs (for example, an image).
You derive program inputs from the output of tools in the program, or
by setting the input values to constants.
Tools that provide output values as input to other tools are (in
alphabetical order):
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Colormap Editors (see <A HREF="usrgu042.htm#HDRCOLMAPE">6.3 , "Using the
Colormap Editor"</A>)

<LI>Macros (see <A HREF="usrgu044.htm#HDRMACROS">7.2 , "Creating and Using
Macros"</A>)
<LI>Modules (see <A HREF="refgu008.htm#HDRMDA">Chapter 1. "Data Explorer

<LI>Transmitters and Receivers (see <A HREF="#HDRTNR">"Using Transmitters and

</UL>
<P>
Before building a visual program, you should be familiar with the information
presented in this chapter as well as the information on Data Explorer
modules presented in <A HREF="refgu008.htm#HDRMDA">Chapter 1. "Data Explorer
Tools"</A> in <I>IBM Visualization Data Explorer Programmer&#39;s Reference</I>.
<P>
<A HREF="qikgu011.htm">Chapter 2. "Tutorial I: Using Data Explorer"</A>

<H3><A NAME="HDRCREATVP" ></A>Creating a Visual Program
</H3>
<A NAME="IDX702"></A>
<P>
To create a visual program, use the Visual Program Editor (VPE) window, in
which you place and connect tools and specify values for those
tools.
<A HREF="#FIGUSE3">Figure 47</A> illustrates the VPE window and
a sample visual program.
<P><B><A NAME="FIGUSE3" HREF="../usrguide.htm#FT_FIGUSE3">Figure 47. VPE
Window</A></B><BR>
<B><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/example1.gif" ALT="Figure example1 not
displayed."></CENTER><BR></B><BR>
<P>The title bar of the VPE displays the name of the current visual program file. On the left side of the window is a palette. You can expand the cateogries by clicking on the (+) sign next to the category name to list the tools associated. The large area on the right side of the window is called the <I>canvas</I>.
You place tools on the canvas to construct a visual program.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX703"></A>
In some cases, the visual program may be too large to be displayed all
at once on the canvas.
On the right and bottom sides of the canvas are <I>scroll bars</I>, which allow you to move the display to different parts of the visual program. To display a different part of the visual program, click on the arrows at the end of the scroll bars, or click and hold the button on the bar between the arrows and move it until the desired portion of the visual program is displayed. Scroll bars may also appear in the tool palette, if the list of tools is too long to fit. <A NAME="IDX704"></A>
<A NAME="IDX705"></A>
<P>
When you place a tool onto the canvas, it is represented by an icon.
<A HREF="#FIGTOOLI">Figure 48</A> illustrates an example of a <I>tool
icon</I>.

<P>
The tool icon, which has a highlighted border when selected, consists
of a rectangle displaying the name of the tool, plus one or more
tabs on the top, the bottom, or the top and the bottom of the
rectangle.
The rectangle is the active area and is used for selecting and moving
the tool.
The tabs on the top represent inputs to the tool, and the tabs on the
bottom represent outputs.
It is possible for a tool to have either no inputs or
no outputs.
Some of a tool&#39;s input tabs may be hidden (i.e., not displayed).
It is possible to reveal the hidden tabs or hide additional tabs.
It is also possible to add or remove input tabs for tools that allow a
variable number of inputs.
On many tools, one or more of the inputs are highlighted with a
different color, indicating that the input is required.
These tabs are discussed in more detail in <A HREF="#HDRSETVAL">"Specifying
Values for a Tool&#39;s Inputs"</A>.

The Drag and Drop capability provided by Data Explorer allows you to move or
copy selected tools within a Data Explorer window (e.g., the VPE or a
control panel) or between different Data Explorer windows (i.e.,
between two different VPE windows).
You can also drag interactor stand-ins to control panels to create
interactors.

To initiate a drag and drop, first select the tools you want to move
or copy, either by rubber-band or shift selection.
Then place the mouse cursor over one of the selected tools and press
the middle mouse button.
Keeping the button pressed, move the cursor to an empty spot on the
canvas and release the button.
A copy of the selected tool will be placed where the mouse button was
released.
To do a cut and drop (move), use Shift-middle mouse button.
<P>
When dragging and dropping tools from the VPE, you may drop the tools
on a VPE in another Data Explorer session or in another VPE (i.e., macro
editor) of the same Data Explorer session.
Interactors in control panels can only be dragged and dropped between
panels in the same visual program.

It is possible to create large visual programs in Data Explorer.
Data Explorer provides two tools, Transmitter and Receiver, to maintain the
modularity and readability of large programs.
These tools allow connections between input and output tabs without
using a visible connecting line.
Using the Transmitter and Receiver tools allows you to separate visual
programs into logical blocks.
For example, the output of several logical blocks can be transmitted
to another block that receives them, collects them, and produces
the image.
Macros, described in <A HREF="usrgu044.htm#HDRMACROS">7.2 , "Creating and Using
Macros"</A>, provide another way to
structure visual programs into logical blocks.

The Receiver automatically assumes the same name as the

These Receivers assume the same name until a new Transmitter is selected.
<P>
The name of a Transmitter and Receiver can be changed using the notation
field of the Configuration dialog box (as described in
<A HREF="#HDRUCB">"Entering Values in a Configuration Dialog Box"</A>).
When you change the name of the Transmitter, all Receivers that share a
name with that Transmitter also change their names.
However, when you change the name of a particular Receiver, the

You can modify the contents of the box directly.
The contents are also automatically updated when changes in the visual program

<H4><A NAME="HDRSVVISPR"></A><U>Saving a Visual Program</U></H4>
<P>
When saving a visual program,
Data Explorer saves the following files:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>The visual program, with a <TT>.net</TT> extension
<LI>The configuration settings, with a <TT>.cfg</TT> extension
</UL>
Data Explorer automatically appends <TT>.net</TT>, <TT>.cfg</TT> to the
name you enter in the <TT><STRONG>Save As...</STRONG></TT>
dialog box.
However, if you enter your file name with a <TT>.net</TT> extension,
Data Explorer does not add another <TT>.net</TT>.
If you end the file name with any other extension, Data Explorer appends the
<TT>.net</TT> extension to the extension you have specified.
For example, a file named <TT>abc.xyz</TT> would be
renamed <TT>abc.xyz.net</TT>.
<P>
An existing file can be saved in the following ways:
<UL>
<P><LI>Under the same name, replacing the previous version of the file
<P><LI>Under a new name or directory, thus creating a new file and
preserving the previous version.
