<P>During the installation of Data Explorer you will be prompted for a user
registration key. You may complete the installation without a key, but
Data Explorer will only run for a few minutes at a time if it is not properly
registered.  To obtain a registration key, send e-mail with your name,
company's name, and the machine's operating system (95 or NT), and the
type of registration (Trial, Beta, Visual Programmer, Visual Programmer
with OpenGL, Runtime, Developer) to ibmdx@watson.ibm.com.
<P>
You may complete the installation and register later by double-clicking
the &quot;Register DX&quot; icon. Make sure to save the registration key
information somewhere safe.
<P>
Installing Data Explorer onto a hard drive is done as follows:
<OL>
<P>
<LI>Place the Data Explorer CD into the CD-ROM drive;

<LI>From the Windows Start menu, choose <TT>Run...</TT> and
enter <TT>D&#58;&#92;setup</TT>, where <TT>D&#58;</TT> is
your CD-ROM drive letter;

<LI>Follow the instructions given.

</OL>
<P>
The install process will create a Data Explorer folder from which you can
immediately start Data Explorer simply by double-clicking on the DX icon.
(This assumes the X server has been installed and configured correctly.)
The Exceed X server need not be started prior to starting Data Explorer, but 
Data Explorer                                                                   
will start more quickly if the X server is already running.
<P>
If you intend to start Data Explorer from the command line,
you should configure the environment so that the PATH variable
includes d:\dx\bin (assuming Data Explorer was installed in d:\dx).
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Header_6" HREF="#PToC_6">2.2 X Server</A></H2>
Data Explorer has been designed to use the Hummingbird Exceed
X Server, but, properly configured, other PC X servers should
work fine also.
The X server configuration notes and troubleshooting below are specific
to the Hummingbird Exceed X server, but may apply to other X
servers in a similar way.
<P>
<B>X Server settings: For best performance with the X server, turn
off Window panning in the X configuration window. Furthermore,
turn off "Full Drag" in the NT Desktop configuration window or
in the Plus!Display settings.
Finally go to <TT>Window Mode-&gt;Advanced</TT> and turn <TT>Delay
Window Mapping</TT> off. Also <TT>Warn on Exit</TT> should be off.
If you don't intend to use the X server to connect to remote X clients,
go to <TT>Transports</TT> and switch to <TT>Local Only</TT>.
</B>
<P>
The DISPLAY environment variable need not be defined, but if it
is defined it should correspond to 0:0, localhost:0, localpc:0,
or hostname:0 (where hostname is the name of the local or remote
display machine).
<P>
If you have the OpenGL version of Data Explorer, you will need to
install Exceed 3D to use OpenGL rendering. Note that even if you don't
have a graphics card, you can still use software based OpenGL.
<P>
You should have TCP/IP installed so that you can ping
localhost and localpc at a command line. If you remove the
computer from a network, this may cease to work unless you
install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter (on NT) or DialUp
adapter (Win95). If you observe slower performance when off
the network, see troubleshooting below. You should always be
able to ping localhost and localpc from a DOS command window.
If you do not have the "ping" command installed on your computer,
it probably means you have not fully installed TCP/IP.
<P>
If you do not have a network adapter card, go to Network
settings under the Control Panel. Using "Add Adapter", add MS
Loopback Adapter (on NT) or DialUp Adapter (Win95).
<P>
You may want to define host names localhost and localpc at
address 127.0.0.1 if your are using Data Explorer without attachment to a
network. Create a HOSTS file in your windows directory or in
your etc directory if you do not already have one. To confirm
that TCP/IP is working, try pinging localhost, localpc, and
127.0.0.1. If you still have problems, try defining them also
in a lmhosts file in the same directories.

<H2><A NAME="Header_8" HREF="#PToC_8">3.1 Samples</A></H2>
<P>To run the samples shipped with Data Explorer, simply double
click on the "DX Startup Menu"
icon and select Samples, then go to
the /dx/samples/programs directory if you are not already there.
A file dialog will appear with the names of the available
program (*.net) files. Select one by double-clicking on the file
name with the left mouse button.  Run the file by selecting
Execute-&gt;Once.  See the on-line help for more information on
options for running Data Explorer.
<P>
Help is available on-line through the Visual Program Editor
(VPE) "Help" menu, or by
placing the cursor over a module and pressing the F1 key.
A description of each sample can be found under Help-&gt;Application
Comment. (You can also view the HTML documentation files by
double-clicking the "DX Help" icon in the Data Explorer
folder, which will launch your current web browser).
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>Although Data Explorer starts in the samples directory by 
default, we                                                                     
strongly recommend doing your own work in a directory completely
separate from the Data Explorer file structure. You might want to make your own
desktop shortcut that starts Data Explorer in your preferred directory. Follow
the instructions that come with Windows to copy the Data Explorer shortcut from
the start menu to the desktop and change its properties so the "Start
in" directory corresponds to your personal directory.
<P>
To run Data Explorer from a DOS command line, make sure the Data Explorer bin 
directory                                                                       
(typically d:&#92;dx&#92;bin) has been added to the Path
environment variable. Then just type <TT>dx</TT> to bring up the Data Explorer
Startup panel, or <TT>dx -edit</TT> to bring up the VPE.
<P>
<P><B>Note: </B>The documentation for the Unix platforms suggests
typing <TT>dx &amp;</TT>. Note that the "&amp;" is a Unix command
option that does not apply to PC environments. Also note that the
documentation refers to directory <TT>/USR/LPP/DX</TT>; when reading
the documentation, regard this as the directory in which you installed
Data Explorer.
<P>
The dx.exe file that launches Data Explorer will automatically define
DXDATA and DXMACROS to point to the sample data and macros.
If you define your own macros and data path, the sample data
and macros will be appended to end of the path list so they
can always be found.

<P>Data Explorer uses forward slash path specifiers, such as
/usr/local/dx.
This is because 1) it helps maintains portability of nets with the Unix
version and 2) in many situations, the "&#92;" character is
interpreted as an escape character.
In all the Data Explorer dialog windows,
forward slashes should be used. This also applies to
environment variables, with the exception of those read
directly by the operating system, such as DXROOT.
<P>
In addition, multiple path specifiers are separated by &#59;
rather than &#58;. Thus the following would be a correct way to
define DXDATA:
<PRE>
     set DXDATA=d&#58;/myfiles/newdata&#59;f&#58;/mydir/mydata
</PRE>

<P>Some large .net files have caused the UI to hang due to a problem with some
X servers. A workaround is to start Data Explorer with the option
<TT>-synchronous</TT>, which should allow large nets to display. If
possible, convert the large program to one that is "pageified", so
that it will be more organized and display faster.
Sometimes the UI may suddenly stop drawing until prompted by a
mouse movement in the VPE window. If the UI seems to stop,
first try moving the mouse in the window.
<P>
Import filters will work, but the filter's directory must be
in the PATH environment variable, and the data file used must be fully
specified. This means you must modify the sample program
ImportExternalFilter.net before it will work. (Add
d&#58;&#92;dx&#92;samples&#92;data to the path and specify
<TT>Import(!externalfilter d:/dx/samples/data/external.data)</TT> -
assuming you have installed dx in d&#58;&#92;dx.)
<P>
The Data Prompter screen is larger than most laptop screens, making it
difficult to access the bottom options. You should be able to access the
entire window by running the X Configuration routine supplied with the X
server to set Window Panning On, with a value of 50 or so.
Unfortunately this will not allow access to the bottom of the prompter
if you have the Auto Hide feature enabled for the Windows Start menu, so
you must disable this (by right clicking on a blank region of the
Windows start menu and selecting properties). Furthermore, you may want
to turn the panning back off when running Data Explorer if you observe any
artifacts due to the window panning feature. It is easy to turn panning
on and off by clicking on the X server option panel that appears on the
desktop when the X server is running.

<P>Make sure you can ping localhost from a command line
successfully, and that it is defined as 127.0.0.1. If you
still have a problem, try defining "localpc" (in addition
to localhost) as 127.0.0.1 in the Windows "hosts" file either
in the WINDOWS directory or in the ETC directory under NT. If
you do not already have a
"hosts" file, look for "hosts.sam" on your disk and copy it
to "hosts", and then make your modifications in the new hosts
file.
If your machine has an IP address, try adding the line:
<PRE>
ip-address              machine-name
</PRE>
where <TT>ip-address</TT> is the machine's IP address, and
<TT>machine-name</TT> is the machine's name.
If you still have problems, try adding localhost and
localpc to the lmhosts file in the same directory as hosts.
<P>
If you are off the network and the X server or Data Explorer takes
a long time to start, you may need to Disable your
name server, using the Windows Control panel-&gt;Network
configuration tool.

<H3><A NAME="Header_22" HREF="#PToC_22">Trouble starting Data Explorer</A></H3>
If you still
seem to be having trouble starting Data Explorer, see if you are using a
socks.cnf file. Check your &#92;windows&#92;system directory (on
Windows 95), or the &#92;etc directory (on Windows NT) for the file
socks.cnf. If you find one, try adding the line:
<PRE>
direct 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
</PRE>
towards the bottom of the file where you find other "direct"
commands. This will prevent local TCP/IP communication from trying to
go to a remote socks server.

<P>The Data Explorer Development version allows the use of DXLink to control
Data Explorer from your application. It also allows the creation of loadable 
modules                                                                         
as DLLs that extend the functionality of Data Explorer by incorporating your own
C-code. Note that the creation of loadable modules requires the
command <TT>awk</TT>, to be available on the computer.
<P>
You should define the following environment variables:
<BR>
<TT>DXROOT=d&#58;&#92;dx</TT>      (or wherever you installed it)<BR>
<TT>ARCH=intelnt</TT>      (this is the same for NT and Win95)<BR>
You should also make sure that d&#58;&#92;dx&#92;bin is in your
path.
<P>
As indicated in the intelnt Makefiles, the following should be defined
during compilation:
<PRE>
ARCH=intelnt
intelnt
</PRE>
<P>
Also, your code should include windows.h and winsock.h as needed.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_36" HREF="#PToC_36">DXLink specific information</A></H3>
<P>You should include a call to initialize sockets in your application using
<PRE>
WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1,1), &wsastartup);
</PRE>
Consult the sample <TT>sealevel.c</TT> for an example of how to do this.
We also recommend using
<PRE>
DXLSetSynchronization(conn, 1);
</PRE>
to run DXLink in synchronized mode.

<P>To avoid a conflict between Data Explorer and Windows header files you should
undefine <TT>ERROR_DATA_INVALID</TT> after loading windows.h.
<P>
In order to use the DLL you should start Data Explorer with
<PRE>
dx -modules d&#58;&#92;where_my_dlls_are -mdf d&#58;&#92;my_mdfs&#92;my_mdf.mdf
</PRE>
In other words, -modules should be a directory containing the DLLs
and -mdf shoud be the actual mdf file for the DLLs.
Remember that "Visual Programmer" versions of Data Explorer will not allow use
of the DLLs, but Runtime and Developer versions will.
