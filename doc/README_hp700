1. System Configuration
 
A. Colormap Considerations 
If you are using a workstation with a CRX adapter, you can reduce the
visual effect of colormap thrashing by setting the environment variable
SB_X_SHARED_CMAP to TRUE so that X and Starbase will use a shared
colormap.
 
If you are using x11start, make sure you set this environment variable
before you issue the x11start command.
 
If you are using the HP VUE (Visual User Environment) add the following
to the end of the Xconfig file:
 
   vuelogin*environment:SB_X_SHARED_CMAP=TRUE
 
The Xconfig file is located in /usr/vue/config/Xconfig for HP/UX 9.0x.
 
This will effectively make the first 8 colormap cells accessible
(read/only) to both X and StarBase, reserve the next 34 cells for X,
and set aside the remaining 214 for StarBase.
 
Since there are relatively few colors available to X, it is possible
that you will get color map allocation errors when invoking Data
Explorer, especially if you use the HP VUE, as it can require all
42 colors reserved for X, depending on the settings of the following
resources:
 
  *colorUse 
  *shadowPixmaps
 
The *colorUse resource determines the number of color sets available in
the current HP VUE color palette, whereas the shadowPixmaps determines
whether shadowing is done with colors or pixmaps.  
 
For HP/UX 9.0x, color usage is reduced in HP VUE by cascading up from the 
'Tool Box' icon, and selecting the following icons in order:
 
        General
        System_admin
        EditResources 
 
Edit the file provided in the last window to include 
 
*ColorUse: LOW_COLOR 
*ShadowPixmaps: TRUE 
 
You will then need to log out from the console and log back in for
these new resources to take effect.
 
B. Default Keyboard Mappings On the Hewlett Packard 9000/700 series
workstations, the Delete key is marked "Del", and is found on the
numeric keypad.

C. DX no longer statically links libC
Data Explorer no longer statically links in libC on hp systems.  
This may be a problem on older hp systems (9.x) where the libC runtime library
was not installed by default. However, this library was on
the original distribution so you should have a copy you 
can install. 
 
 
2. Hardware Rendering Considerations
 
A. Shared Library Support for Hardware Rendering
When hardware rendering is requested for the first time, the executive
dynamically loads /usr/lpp/dx/bin_hp700/DXhwdd.sl and the StarBase shared 
libraries.  If one of these is not present then hardware rendering will 
be disabled.
 
B. Hardware Rendering Not Available Message
When the message 'Hardware rendering not available: /usr/lib/libsb.sl not
found' appears, then StarBase shared library or run-time support has 
not been installed. 
 
C. Shared Memory Usage
The hardware rendering software uses shared memory segments.  If Data 
Explorer exits abnormally after beginning hardware rendering, then these 
shared memory segments may not be properly deallocated.  Use the 'ipcs' 
command to see if this has happened and use the 'ipcrm' command to remove 
them.  If these are not removed they may hamper subsequent executions.
 
D. The CRX Adapter and Direct Interactors
When using the direct interactors and hardware rendering on a CRX graphics 
card, zoom boxes and probe points may cause minor image corruption while the 
mouse button is depressed.  When the mouse button is released, the proper 
image is generated. 
 
E. Resizing in Script Mode
For script mode and hardware rendering, an open or resize of the display 
window might produce a Starbase error.
 
F. Near Clipping in Perspective Projections 
When navigating into an object, the near clip plane may clip graphics
primitives to their triangle boundaries instead of the exact intersection
with the clip plane.  
 
G. Z-buffer  
Hardware rendering may be performed on a system without a z-buffer card
if PowerShade is installed on that system.
