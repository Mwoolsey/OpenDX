1. System Configuration 
 
A. Keyboard Mappings
The DEC Alpha may issue a warning message when dx is started.  The message
complains about an illegal mnemonic character that it could not do a 
keysym to keycode conversion on.  The offending key is the "End" key.  The
solution is use the xmodmap facility to "change the keycaps" on the DEC
keyboard.  The Alpha executes a file called .X11Startup in your home 
directory when you log in.  Place the following line of code in the
.X11Startup in your home directory:
 
    xmodmap -e "keycode 0x74 = End"
 
This will cause the F14 key on the DEC LK401 (American) keyboard to
behave like the "End" key.
 
This will handle the case where you log into the DEC Alpha.  If you are
running from another workstation and displaying to the DEC Alpha, you
should execute the following commands (in order):
 
    1. export DISPLAY=alpha_system_name:0 (ksh) or
       setenv DISPLAY alpha_system_name:0 (csh)
    2. xmodmap -e "keycode 0x74 = End"
    3. dx
 
                                 /-----|
    Data Explorer interpets the <   X  |  above the Return key as "Delete".
                                 \-----|
 
B. X warnings during drag and drop 
The X server on OSF/1 V2 can exhaust its resources during drag and drop
operations.  If you see several Xlib warnings on stderr while dragging
several nodes in the Visual Program Editor, then the following change 
to /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers will solve the problem:
 
before:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X
 
after:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X -bs -su
  
This disables backing store and save unders.  After making this
change the X server must be restarted, this is most easily accomplished
with the following (as root):
 
/sbin/init.d/xdm stop
/sbin/init.d/xdm start 

 
2. Hardware Rendering Considerations
 
A. Shared Library Support for Hardware Rendering
When hardware rendering is requested for the first time, the executive
dynamically loads /usr/lpp/dx/bin_alphax/DXhwddOGL.o and the OpenGL shared 
libraries.  If one of these is not present then hardware rendering will 
be disabled.
 
B. Hardware Rendering Not Available Message
When the message 'Hardware rendering not available: /usr/lib/libGL.a not
found' appears, then OpenGL shared library or run-time support has 
not been installed. 
 
C. Transparency not enabled on the PXG adaptor family
When using hardware rendering, transparency is not enabled on the 
PXG family of graphic adaptors because of performance reasons.
However, the existance of the environment variable DX_PXG_TRANSPARENCY
will enable the use of transparency on that adaptor.
