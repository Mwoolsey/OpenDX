  ------------------
  3.1  Data Explorer
 
 
     During  the  installation  of Data Explorer you will be prompted for a
     user registration key. You may complete  the  installation  without  a
     key, but Data Explorer will only run for a few minutes at a time if it
     is not properly registered.  To obtain a registration key, send e-mail
     with your name, company's name, and the machine's operating system (95
     or  NT), and the type of registration (Trial, Beta, Visual Programmer,
     Visual   Programmer    with    OpenGL,    Runtime,    Developer)    to
     ibmdx@watson.ibm.com.
 
     You   may   complete   the   installation   and   register   later  by
     double-clicking  the  "Register  DX"  icon.  Make  sure  to  save  the
     registration key information somewhere safe.
 
     Installing Data Explorer onto a hard drive is done as follows:
 
     1.  Place the Data Explorer CD into the CD-ROM drive;
 
     2.  From the Windows Start menu, choose "Run..." and enter "D:\setup",
         where "D:" is your CD-ROM drive letter;
 
     3.  Follow the instructions given.
 
     The  install process will create a Data Explorer folder from which you
     can immediately start Data Explorer simply by double-clicking  on  the
     DX icon.  (This assumes the X server has been installed and configured
     correctly.)  The Exceed X server need not be started prior to starting
     Data  Explorer,  but  Data  Explorer  will start more quickly if the X
     server is already running.
 
     If you intend to start Data Explorer from the command line, you should
     configure the environment so that the PATH variable includes d:\dx\bin
     (assuming Data Explorer was installed in d:\dx).
 
 
  -------------
  3.2  X Server
 
     Data Explorer has been  designed  to  use  the  Hummingbird  Exceed  X
     Server,  but, properly configured, other PC X servers should work fine
     also.  The X server configuration notes and troubleshooting below  are
     specific  to the Hummingbird Exceed X server, but may apply to other X
     servers in a similar way.
 
     X Server settings: For best performance with the X  server,  turn  off
     Window  panning  in  the X configuration window. Furthermore, turn off
     "Full  Drag"  in  the  NT  Desktop  configuration  window  or  in  the
     Plus!Display  settings.    Finally  go to "Window Mode-->Advanced" and
     turn "Delay Window Mapping" off. Also "Warn on Exit"  should  be  off.
     If  you  don't  intend  to  use  the  X  server to connect to remote X
     clients, go to "Transports" and switch to "Local Only".
 
     The DISPLAY environment variable need not be defined,  but  if  it  is
     defined  it  should  correspond  to  0:0,  localhost:0,  localpc:0, or
     hostname:0 (where hostname is the name of the local or remote  display
     machine).
 
     If  you  have  the  OpenGL  version of Data Explorer, you will need to
     install Exceed 3D to use OpenGL rendering. Note that even if you don't
     have a graphics card, you can still use software based OpenGL.
 
     You should have TCP/IP installed so that you can  ping  localhost  and
     localpc  at a command line. If you remove the computer from a network,
     this may cease to work  unless  you  install  the  Microsoft  Loopback
     Adapter  (on  NT)  or  DialUp  adapter  (Win95). If you observe slower
     performance when off  the  network,  see  troubleshooting  below.  You
     should always be able to ping localhost and localpc from a DOS command
     window.    If  you  do  not  have the "ping" command installed on your
     computer, it probably means you have not fully installed TCP/IP.
 
     If you do not have a network adapter  card,  go  to  Network  settings
     under  the Control Panel. Using "Add Adapter", add MS Loopback Adapter
     (on NT) or DialUp Adapter (Win95).
 
     You may want to define host names localhost  and  localpc  at  address
     127.0.0.1  if  your  are  using  Data Explorer without attachment to a
     network. Create a HOSTS file in your windows directory or in your  etc
     directory  if  you  do not already have one. To confirm that TCP/IP is
     working, try pinging localhost, localpc, and 127.0.0.1. If  you  still
     have  problems,  try  defining them also in a lmhosts file in the same
     directories.

  4.1  Samples
 
 
     To run the samples shipped with Data Explorer, simply double click  on
     the  "DX  Startup  Menu"  icon  and  select  Samples,  then  go to the
     /dx/samples/programs directory if you are not already there.   A  file
     dialog  will  appear  with  the names of the available program (*.net)
     files. Select one by double-clicking on the file name  with  the  left
     mouse  button.    Run  the file by selecting Execute-->Once.   See the
     on-line  help  for  more  information  on  options  for  running  Data
     Explorer.
 
     Help  is  available  on-line  through  the Visual Program Editor (VPE)
     "Help" menu, or by placing the cursor over a module and  pressing  the
     F1   key.      A  description  of  each  sample  can  be  found  under
     Help-->Application Comment. (You can also view the HTML  documentation
     files  by  double-clicking  the  "DX  Help"  icon in the Data Explorer
     folder, which will launch your current web browser).
 
     Note:  Although Data Explorer  starts  in  the  samples  directory  by
     default,  we  strongly  recommend  doing  your own work in a directory
     completely separate from the Data Explorer file structure.  You  might
     want  to  make  your own desktop shortcut that starts Data Explorer in
     your preferred directory.  Follow  the  instructions  that  come  with
     Windows  to copy the Data Explorer shortcut from the start menu to the
     desktop  and  change  its  properties  so  the  "Start  in"  directory
     corresponds to your personal directory.
 
     To  run  Data  Explorer  from  a  DOS command line, make sure the Data
     Explorer bin directory (typically d:\dx\bin) has  been  added  to  the
     Path  environment  variable.  Then just type "dx" to bring up the Data
     Explorer Startup panel, or "dx -edit" to bring up the VPE.
 
     Note:  The documentation for the Unix platforms  suggests  typing  "dx
     &".  Note that the "&" is a Unix command option that does not apply to
     PC environments. Also note that the documentation refers to  directory
     "/USR/LPP/DX";  when  reading  the  documentation,  regard this as the
     directory in which you installed Data Explorer.
 
     The dx.exe file that launches Data Explorer will automatically  define
     DXDATA  and  DXMACROS  to point to the sample data and macros.  If you
     define your own macros and data path, the sample data and macros  will
     be appended to end of the path list so they can always be found.
 
 
  -------------------------------------------------------
  4.2  To get command line help and Data Explorer options
 
     Type:
 
       dx -help
 
     or
 
       dx -morehelp
 
     (assumes "d:\dx\bin" is in the path)
 
     For  more help, double-click on the "DX Help" icon which will load the
     HTML documentation in  your  Web  browser.  For  a  tutorial  on  Data
     Explorer, double-click on the "DX Tutorial" icon.
 
 
  -------------------------------------------------
  4.3  File name specification: / vs. \ and ; vs. :
 
 
     Data Explorer uses forward slash path specifiers, such as /usr/lpp/dx.
     This  is  because  1)  it helps maintains portability of nets with the
     Unix  version  and  2)  in  many  situations,  the  "\"  character  is
     interpreted  as  an escape character.  In all the Data Explorer dialog
     windows,  forward  slashes  should  be  used.  This  also  applies  to
     environment  variables,  with  the exception of those read directly by
     the operating system, such as DXROOT.
 
     In addition, multiple path specifiers are separated by ;  rather  than
     :. Thus the following would be a correct way to define DXDATA:
 
            set DXDATA=d:/myfiles/newdata;f:/mydir/mydata
 
 
 
  -----------------------------------
  4.4  Known issues with this version
 
 
     Some large .net files have caused the UI to hang due to a problem with
     some X servers. A workaround is to start Data Explorer with the option
     "-synchronous", which should allow large nets to display. If possible,
     convert  the large program to one that is "pageified", so that it will
     be more organized and display faster.  Sometimes the UI  may  suddenly
     stop  drawing until prompted by a mouse movement in the VPE window. If
     the UI seems to stop, first try moving the mouse in the window.
 
     Import filters will work, but the filter's directory must  be  in  the
     PATH  environment  variable,  and  the  data  file  used must be fully
     specified.  This  means   you   must   modify   the   sample   program
     ImportExternalFilter.net  before it will work. (Add d:\dx\samples\data
     to     the     path      and      specify      "Import(!externalfilter
     d:/dx/samples/data/external.data)" - assuming you have installed dx in
     d:\dx.)
 
     The Data Prompter screen is larger than most laptop screens, making it
     difficult  to  access the bottom options. You should be able to access
     the entire window by running the X Configuration routine supplied with
     the X server to set Window Panning On, with  a  value  of  50  or  so.
     Unfortunately this will not allow access to the bottom of the prompter
     if  you have the Auto Hide feature enabled for the Windows Start menu,
     so you must disable this (by right clicking on a blank region  of  the
     Windows  start  menu  and  selecting properties). Furthermore, you may
     want to turn the panning back off when running Data  Explorer  if  you
     observe any artifacts due to the window panning feature. It is easy to
     turn  panning on and off by clicking on the X server option panel that
     appears on the desktop when the X server is running.
 
 
  --------------------
  4.5  Troubleshooting
 
 
 
  Starting DX produces warning screen: XLIB - Cannot open connect stream.
 
 
     The X server is unable to  start  on  its  own,  so  try  starting  it
     manually.
 
     Make sure you can ping localhost from a DOS command line.
 
 
  The name specified is not recognized as an internal or external command.
 
 
     Make sure d:\dx\bin has been added to the PATH environment variable if
     you are starting Data Explorer from a command line.
 
 
  Can't find file in directory or DXDATA path
 
 
     Make  sure  you  have correctly defined DXDATA to include all the data
     directories you need to access, either  by  defining  the  environment
     variable DXDATA or at the command line, "dx -data ..."
 
 
  Can't find macro ...
 
 
     Make sure you have correctly defined DXMACROS to include all the macro
     directories you need to access, as described for DXDATA above.
 
 
  Trouble double-clicking on items and general mouse interaction issues
 
 
     Study  the  various  XConfig  options  in  Exceed  and see if you find
     settings that work better for you.
 
 
  X Server complains when you close a window
 
 
     Find the "Warn on Exit" option in the X  server  configuration  dialog
     that comes with Exceed, and turn it off.
 
 
  Images first appear red
 
 
     This  appears  to  be  related  to  using  8-bit color depth with a 3D
     version of the X server. Change the color depth of  the  image  (using
     "Image-->Options-->Image Depth") to 24-bit and the colors will display
     correctly.
 
 
  Nothing happens when Start Server-->Options... is clicked.
 
 
     See  4.11,  "X  server  settings (for best performance)" and make sure
     "Delay Window Mapping" is off.
 
 
  Slow startup/execution when off the network.
 
 
     Make sure you can ping localhost from a command line successfully, and
     that it is defined as 127.0.0.1. If you  still  have  a  problem,  try
     defining  "localpc"  (in  addition  to  localhost) as 127.0.0.1 in the
     Windows "hosts" file either in the WINDOWS directory  or  in  the  ETC
     directory  under  NT.  If you do not already have a "hosts" file, look
     for "hosts.sam" on your disk and copy it to  "hosts",  and  then  make
     your  modifications  in the new hosts file.  If your machine has an IP
     address, try adding the line:
 
       ip-address              machine-name
 
     where "ip-address" is the machine's IP address, and "machine-name"  is
     the  machine's name.  If you still have problems, try adding localhost
     and localpc to the lmhosts file in the same directory as hosts.
 
     If you are off the network and the X server or Data Explorer  takes  a
     long  time  to  start, you may need to Disable your name server, using
     the Windows Control panel-->Network configuration tool.
 
 
  Trouble starting Data Explorer
 
     If you still seem to be having trouble starting Data Explorer, see  if
     you  are  using a socks.cnf file. Check your \windows\system directory
     (on Windows 95), or the \etc directory (on Windows NT)  for  the  file
     socks.cnf. If you find one, try adding the line:
 
       direct 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
 
     towards the bottom of the file where you find other "direct" commands.
     This  will  prevent  local TCP/IP communication from trying to go to a
     remote socks server.
 
 
  UI is unable to connect to the Executive
 
 
     Errors during initialization may be due to  incomplete  TCP/IP  setup.
     If  the  UI  comes  up but is unable to connect to the Executive, make
     sure TCP/IP is set up correctly. Also, make  sure  you  don't  already
     have a copy of the Executive running.
 
 
  DXhwddOGL.dll not found
 
 
     This  message  occurs  when  an Image window is trying to display with
     hardware rendering, but you do not have a 3D X  server  installed.  To
     prevent  the error, switch the Image window to software rendering mode
     (Options-->Rendering Options-->Software) or install a  3D  version  of
     the X server, along with the OpenGL version of Data Explorer.
 
 
  Visual program doesn't completly load
 
 
     Try  starting Data Explorer with the "-synchronous" option. Then break
     your network into pages.

  4.6  Windows Tips
 
 
 
  How to connect a Windows dx ui to a Unix dx executive
 
 
     1.  Start the executive on the Unix machine with dx  -exonly  -license
         self
 
     2.  Note the port number displayed (assume it's 1900)
 
     3.  Start the UI on the PC with dx -host unix_host_name -port 1900
 
     4.  The Windows UI should then connect to the Unix executive

  4.7  Data Explorer registration types
 
 
 
  Visual Programmer
 
 
     Allows creation of nets (visual programs) but does not allow execution
     of  a  user's  own  custom  modules. It also does not allow the use of
     hardware (OpenGL) rendering.
 
 
  Visual Programmer with OpenGL
 
 
     Same as Visual Programmer  but  allows  OpenGL  rendering.  This  also
     requires  Hummingbird  Exceed  with  Exceed 3D.   You do not need a 3D
     hardware graphics card to use OpenGL, as software-based OpenGL will be
     used automatically if no 3D hardware graphics card is found.
 
 
  Runtime
 
 
     Allows loading and running of nets  and  custom  modules  with  OpenGL
     support  (as  long  as  Exceed 3D is installed as described above) but
     does not allow the creation or modification of visual programs.
 
 
  Developer
 
 
     Same as Visual Programmer with OpenGL but also allows the creation and
     loading of custom modules that incorporate a  user's  C-code.    These
     modules are compiled as DLLs that can be loaded by the DX executive.
 
 
  Beta or Trial
 
 
     Allows full use of the product and development components but only for
     a brief trial period.
 
 
  -----------------------------------
  4.8  Server and Client installation
 
 
     If  you have purchased a multi-user registration for Data Explorer you
     may install it once on a networked computer. Other computers that have
     that computer mounted on a remote drive may  perform  a  quick  client
     installation  that does not install files locally, nor does it require
     re-entry of the registration information.
 
 
  --------------------------------------------
  4.9  Data Explorer Development Version Notes
 
 
     The Data Explorer Development version allows  the  use  of  DXLink  to
     control  Data  Explorer  from  your  application.  It  also allows the
     creation of loadable modules as DLLs that extend the functionality  of
     Data Explorer by incorporating your own C-code. Note that the creation
     of loadable modules requires the command "awk", to be available on the
     computer.
 
     You should define the following environment variables:
 
     "DXROOT=d:\dx"      (or wherever you installed it)
     "ARCH=intelnt"      (this is the same for NT and Win95)
 
     You should also make sure that d:\dx\bin is in your path.
 
     As indicated in the intelnt Makefiles, the following should be defined
     during compilation:
 
       ARCH=intelnt
       intelnt
 
     Also, your code should include windows.h and winsock.h as needed.
 
 
  DXLink specific information
 
 
     You  should  include  a call to initialize sockets in your application
     using
 
       WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(1,1), &wsastartup);
 
     Consult the sample "sealevel.c" for an example of how to do this.   We
     also recommend using
 
       DXLSetSynchronization(conn, 1);
 
     to run DXLink in synchronized mode.
 
 
  Loadable modules (DLL) specific information
 
 
     To avoid a conflict between Data Explorer and Windows header files you
     should undefine "ERROR_DATA_INVALID" after loading windows.h.
 
     In order to use the DLL you should start Data Explorer with
 
       dx -modules d:\where_my_dlls_are -mdf d:\my_mdfs\my_mdf.mdf
 
     In other words, -modules should be a directory containing the DLLs and
     -mdf shoud be the actual mdf file for the DLLs.  Remember that "Visual
     Programmer"  versions of Data Explorer will not allow use of the DLLs,
     but Runtime and Developer versions will.

  4.10  Installing Hummingbird Exceed (and Exceed 3D) from the included trial
  diskette.
 
 
     1.  Follow directions on the CD appropriate for your Windows  version:
         95 or NT.
 
     2.  You  must install Exceed (or a different X server) in order to use
         Data Explorer.
 
     3.  If your Data Explorer  registration  allows  OpenGL  support  (see
         above) you should also install Exceed 3D after installing Exceed.
 
     4.  For  Data  Explorer  you  only need the X server components of the
         Hummingbird product suite (i.e. Exceed and, for OpenGL, Exceed 3D)
         but you may have other uses for the networking tools.
 
     5.  The included Hummingbird trial disk is  a  free  trial  that  will
         expire  after  installation, but included on the disk are ordering
         instructions for purchasing the X server at a discount  with  your
         Data  Explorer  purchase.  You must purchase a licensed version of
         Exceed in order to keep it from expiring. If you also need  OpenGL
         support you should purchase Exceed 3D in addition.
 
 
 
  ----------------------------------------------
  4.11  X server settings (for best performance)
 
 
     1.  Delay Window mapping should be off
 
     2.  Warn On Exit should be off
 
     3.  Window panning should be off
 
     4.  "Transports" should be local/Network, but if you have trouble when
         off a network try setting Transports to local only.
