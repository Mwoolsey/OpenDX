1. System Configuration 
 
A. Default Keyboard Mappings
On the Sun SPARCstations, Ctrl+Delete is Ctrl+Del.  "Del" is found
on the numeric keypad.  Data Explorer responds to the "End" key and arrow
keys found on the numeric keypad.  The mnemonic key to pull down the menus
uses the diamond key as the modifier, instead of the Alt key.
 
B. Memory Usage
On Sun running SunOS 4.1.x, the Data Explorer executive uses the
contents of the /etc/dmesg file to determine the amount of physical memory
available on the workstation.  From this amount of physical memory,
it determines an allowable memory size based on the algorithm described 
in the architecture independent README.  If this file is not available 
for reading or the amount of physical memory is not indicated in the file, 
then the executive uses a default memory size of 32 megabytes.  If you 
wish to run Data Explorer with more or less memory than the default, then 
use "dx -memory #" where '#' is a number in megabytes. 
 
C. Running DX elsewhere and displaying on OpenWindows
Running an OSF/Motif Version 1.2 client on another machine and displaying
the windows on OpenWindows under SunOS 4.1.x can cause the OpenWindows
server to ignore button presses when displaying popup or pulldown menus.
Data Explorer, when run on SGIs, Data General AViiONs, Digital Equipment 
Corporation workstations, and Sun workstations as an OSF/Motif 1.2 client
shows these problems.  In these cases, either kill the user interface from
the remote machine, or use OSF/Motif keyboard handling to terminate Data
Explorer.
 
 
 
2. Hardware Rendering Considerations
 
A. Shared Library Support for Hardware Rendering
When hardware rendering is requested for the first time, the executive
dynamically loads /usr/lpp/dx/bin_sun4/DXhwdd.so and the xgl shared
libraries.  If one of these is not present then hardware rendering will
be disabled.
 
B. Hardware Rendering Not Available Message
When the message 'Hardware rendering not available: /usr/lib/libxgl.so not
found' appears, then xgl shared library or run-time support has not been
installed.
 
C. Transparency
Transparency is not handled by the Sun Hardware Renderer.
 
D. SunOS 4.1.2 and Two Hardware Windows
When rendering with two Hardware windows and using direct interactors,
images may be corrupted and appear in the opposite window. This is fixed
with SunOS 4.1.3.
 
 
3. On Line Help Path Menu
In the current implementation of Data Explorer, the pop-up menu
providing the current help path is not supported.
 
4. Message "dlopen:stub interception failed"
If the message 'dlopen:stub interception failed' results when attempting
hardware rendering it may be a result of a problem on SunOS when there
are references in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to directories
that are by default searched by the dynamic loader (e.g. /lib or /usr/lib).
This can be worked around by removing any references to directories that
are searched by default.  This includes removing softlinks such as
/usr/ucblib which may be linked to /usr/lib.
