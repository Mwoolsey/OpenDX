1. Hardware Rendering on SGI Platforms
 
A. Exceeding System/Process Memory 
The most recent object displayed is stored in system memory. If this object
is very large it is possible to exceed the system/process memory limits.
If this occurs you will receive many errors of the following form:
 ERR#2_gl_makeroom
 
The only known workaround is to reduce the size of the object(s).
 
 
2. Adding a Module
 
A. Using the Module Builder 
When using the module builder to build a full dxexec, at link time the
following warning message may appear:
   /usr/bin/ld:
   Warning: sscanf: multiply defined
            previous (used) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a':
            new (ignored) definition from '/usr/lib/libmpc.a'
 
This message should be ignored.
 
B. Bad File Magic Number error
If IRIX 5 is not installed on the system, the linker will give
the error message "Object file format error, bad file magic number".
 
 
3. Gamma Correction
If you are displaying on an SGI display which already does gamma
correction, you can disable the gamma correction done by Data Explorer
by setting the DXGAMMA environment variable to 1.0 before starting DX.
