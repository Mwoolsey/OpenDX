1. Displaying on an IBM POWER Visualization Video Controller 
 
A. Clipping of IBM POWER Visualization System (PVS) Generated Images
Images generated by PVS are not clipped using standard X11 conventions.
This has two major implications:
 
      - Data Explorer image windows should not be overlapped.
 
      - The colorbar display of the Colormap editor should not overlap 
          image windows.
 
The failure to follow these rules may result in image corruption.
 
B. Double Buffering Artifacts
If a visual program contains Display modules with explicitly set "where"
parameters or contains more than one disjoint network, double buffering
artifacts may occur.
 
C. Large windows and the IBM POWER Visualization System/Video Controller
When trying to create a very large window (close to the resolution of the
screen) with Data Explorer, for display on the IBM POWER Visualization
System/Video Controller, please set the resource "mwm*limitResize: false" for
mwm, for example in your .Xdefaults file.
 
D. Moving windows off the left side of the screen
If a window is moved off the left side of the IBM POWER Visualization
System/Video Controller screen, double buffering artifacts may occur.
