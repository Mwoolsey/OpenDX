This window allows you to specify various characteristics of your data and the arrangement of the data in the file.  The fields presented depend on your choices in the initial Data Prompter window. At a minimum, you need to tell Data Explorer the file name and grid size (or number of points if the data are scattered). You can also use the Header button to skip information at the top of the file. If you would like to see your data file, click on the ... button to the right of the data file name field, and choose "Browser".

The left side of the window allows you to specify information about the data set as a whole; the right side is used to specify information about individual fields in a file, if more than one variable is contained in it. By default, the data are assumed to be scalar, floating point, though you can change these on a per-field basis.

Once you have described your data, choose Save As from the File menu to save the description. Once you have done this, the Visualize button on the initial prompter window will become enabled, allowing you to see a visualization of your data.
