Here's some help on how to specify the various types of variables for the
Value field of the Configuration Dialog box:

  strings: 
    you may type the string with or without double quotes surrounding it. If 
    you leave the quotes off, the User Interface will add them for you.

  integers: 
    enter the integer without a decimal point, e.g.   1 or 104

  scalars: 
    floating point numbers. You may enter the number with or 
    without decimal points. For values where either an integer or a scalar is 
    acceptable, numbers without decimal points will be treated as integers

    (both integers and scalars may also be entered in scientific notation, 
    e.g. 1e10.)

  vectors: 
    use square brackets to define the vector. Components of the vector may 
    be separated by either spaces or commas (or both). For example, the 
    following are valid vectors:

    [1, 3.0, 1.3]   [1 4 5]

  values:
    may be integers, scalars, or vectors

  lists: 
    use curly braces to define lists. Entries in the list may be separated 
    by either spaces or commas.  (In Data Explorer, a list is the same as 
    an "Array")

    For example:
          integer list:   {1, 3, 3}
          vector list: {[1, 2][3.4, 2][2.0, 3]}
          string list: {"one" "two" "three"}

    You can also quickly specify a "regular" list (a list 
    with items equally spaced) with the following syntax:    
    {a .. b : c}
    where a is the starting value, b is the ending value, and c is the 
    increment (which defaults to 1 if unspecified. For example,

    {-1 1 3 5 7} is equivalent to {-1 .. 9 : 2}

  matrices: 
    use nested square brackets, e.g. [[1, 2][2,3]]

  Fields, Groups, Objects, and Cameras cannot be created by typing into the
  configuration dialog box. They must be passed in via wires from other
  modules
