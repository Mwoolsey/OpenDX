Import Data...         
                       Starts the Data Prompter, an easy way to
                       describe your data to Data Explorer and, if
                       necessary, have an importable file created 
                       automatically for you.  You will also have the 
                       opportunity to have Data Explorer run a 
                       general-purpose visual program to visualize 
                       your imported data.
