OpenDX is no longer supported by IBM; however, many of the developers
still answer questions on the OpenDX mailing lists.

A few vendors provide commercial technical support. One such vendor is
Visualization and Imagery Solutions, Inc. Other vendors can be found in
the community links at www.opendx.org 

If you would like to contact a support person, please have the following 
information available:

     - The version of DX that you are running.  This may be obtained
         with 'dx -version' or the Help menu's 'Product Information' option.

If this is a problem report, please also have the following information:

    - What was the sequence of events that lead to the problem.
    - The exact wording of any error messages that appeared.
    - The operating system, level, and hardware that you are running on
    - Your graphics adapter, if the problem is related to hardware rendering.

There are a number of resources that can be used to get support, information 
and publicly available software related to Data Explorer from other Data 
Explorer users. These include the following:
 
    - comp.graphics.apps.data-explorer 
          Fairly inactive usenet newsgroup, for better response, use the 
          mailing lists. 
    - Mailing Lists 
          There are four mailing lists; opendx-dev, opendx-users, 
          opendx-general, and opendx-announce. If you want to subscribe, just 
          send a mail message to <majordx@opendx.watson.ibm.com> with the 
          following in the message body (not the subject!). (The "end" keeps 
          Majordomo from trying to treat any signature text as commands.)
