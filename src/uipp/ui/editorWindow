The Visual Program Editor allows you to view, modify, or create visual programs. Tools are chosen from the palettes at left and connected together in the large workspace (the canvas).

If a visual program is already loaded, you can execute it using "Execute Once" in the "Execute" pull down. If you want to load a visual program, first select the "Open Program" option in the "File" menu, then specify a file name in the File Selection dialog which appears.

If you want to save a visual program you have created or modified, select "Save As" from the "File" menu.
